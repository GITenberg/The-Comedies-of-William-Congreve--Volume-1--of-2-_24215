class="pagenum">p. vii</span>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<h3>I.</h3>
<p>Before repeating such known facts of Congreve&rsquo;s life as
seem agreeable to the present occasion, and before attempting
(with the courage of one&rsquo;s office) to indicate with truth
what manner of man he was, and what are the varying qualities of
his four comedies, it seems well to discuss and have done with
two questions, obviously pertinent indeed, but of a wider scope
than the works of any one writer.</p>
<p>The first is a stupid question, which may be happily dismissed
with brief ceremony.&nbsp; Grossness of language&mdash;the phrase
is an assumption&mdash;is a matter of time and place, a relative
matter altogether.&nbsp; There is a thing, and a generation finds
a name for it.&nbsp; The delicacy which prompts a later
generation to reject that name is by no means necessarily a
result of stricter habits, is far more often due to the flatness
which comes of untiring repetition and to the greater piquancy of
litotes.&nbsp; I am told that there are, or were, people in
America who reject the word &lsquo;leg&rsquo; as a gross word,
but they must have found a synonym.&nbsp; So there is not a word
in Congreve for which there is not some equivalent expression in
contemporary writing.&nbsp; He says this or that: your modern
writers say so-and-so.&nbsp; One man may even think the
monosyllables in better taste than the periphrases.&nbsp; Another
may sacrifice to his intolerance thereof such enjoyment as he was
capable of taking from the greatest triumphs of diction or
observation: he is free to choose.&nbsp; It may be granted that
to one unfamiliar with the English of two centuries since the
grossness of Congreve&rsquo;s language may seem <!-- page
viii--><a name="pageviii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
viii</span>excessive&mdash;like splashes of colour occurring too
frequently in the arrangement of a wall.&nbsp; But that is merely
a result of novelty: given time and habit, a more artistic
perspective will be achieved.</p>
<p>The second question is more complex.&nbsp; Since Jeremy
Collier let off his <i>Short View of the Immorality and
Profaneness of the English Stage</i>, there has never lacked a
critic to chastise or to deplore&mdash;the more effective and
irritating course&mdash;not simply the coarseness but, the
immorality of our old comedies, their attitude towards and their
peculiar interests in life.&nbsp; Without affirming that we are
now come to the Golden Age of criticism, one may rejoice that
modern methods have taught quite humble critics to discriminate
between issues, and to deal with such a matter as this with some
mental detachment.&nbsp; The great primal fallacy comes from a
habit of expecting everything in everything.&nbsp; Just as in a
picture it is not enough for some people that it is well drawn
and well painted, but they demand an interesting story, a fine
sentiment, a great thought: so since our national glory is
understood to be the happy home, the happy home must be
triumphant everywhere, even in satiric comedy.&nbsp; The best
expression of this fallacy is in Thackeray.&nbsp; Concluding a
most eloquent, and a somewhat patronising examination of
Congreve, &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; he exclaims, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s a
weary feast, that banquet of wit where no love is.&rsquo;&nbsp;
The answer is plain: comedy of manners is comedy of manners, and
satire is satire; introduce &lsquo;love&rsquo;&mdash;an appeal,
one supposes, to sympathy with strictly legitimate and common
affection and a glorification of the happy home&mdash;and the
rules of your art compel you to satirise affection and to make
the happy home ridiculous: a truly deplorable work, which the
incriminated dramatists were discreet enough for the most part to
avoid.&nbsp; The remark brings us to the first of the
half-truths, which cause the complexity of the subject.&nbsp; The
dramatists whose withers the well-intentioned and disastrous
Collier wrung seem to have thought their best answer <!-- page
ix--><a name="pageix"></a><span class="pagenum">p. ix</span>was
to pose as people with a mission&mdash;certainly Congreve so
posed&mdash;to reform the world with an exhibition of its
follies.&nbsp; An amusing answer, no doubt, of which the
absurdity is obvious!&nbsp; It does, however, contain a
half-truth.&nbsp; The idea of <i>The Way of the World&rsquo;s</i>
reforming adulterers&mdash;observe the quotation from Horace on
the title-page&mdash;is a little delicious; yet the exhibition in
a ludicrous light of the thing satirised is surely an end of
satiric comedy?&nbsp; The right of the matter is indicated in a
sentence which occurs in the dedication of <i>The
Double-Dealer</i> far more wisely than in Congreve&rsquo;s answer
to Collier: &lsquo;I should be very glad of an opportunity to
make my compliment to those ladies who are offended: but they can
no more expect it in a comedy, than to be tickled by a surgeon,
when he&rsquo;s letting &rsquo;em blood.&rsquo;&nbsp; Something
more than a half-truth is in Charles Lamb&rsquo;s theory, that
the old comedy &lsquo;has no reference whatever to the world that
is&rsquo;: that it is &lsquo;the Utopia of Gallantry&rsquo;
merely.&nbsp; Literally, historically, the theory is a
fantasy.&nbsp; What the Restoration dramatists did not borrow
from France was inspired directly by the court of Charles the
Second, and nobody conversant with the memoirs of that court can
have any difficulty in matching the fiction with reality.&nbsp; I
imagine that Congreve in part accepted a tradition of the stage,
but I am also perfectly well assured that he depicted what he
saw.&nbsp; How far the virtues we should associate with the
Charles the Second spirit may atone for its vices is a question
which would take us far into moral philosophy.&nbsp; It is enough
to remark that those vices are the exclusive possession of no
period: so long as society is constituted in anything like its
present order, there must be a section of it for which those
vices are the main interest in life.&nbsp; But Charles
Lamb&rsquo;s gay and engaging defiance of the kill-joys of his
day has this value: it is most certainly just to say that, in
appreciating satiric comedy, &lsquo;our coxcombical moral
sense&rsquo; must be &lsquo;for a little transitory ease
excluded.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page x--><a name="pagex"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
x</span>For one may apprehend the whole truth to be somewhat
thus.&nbsp; Satiric comedy, or comedy of manners, is the art of
making ludicrous in dramatic form some phase of life.&nbsp; The
writers of our old comedy thought that certain
vices&mdash;gambling, adultery, and the like&mdash;formed a phase
of life which for divers reasons, essential and accidental, lent
itself best to their purpose.&nbsp; They may, or may not, have
thought they were doing society a service: their real
justification is that, as artists, they had to take for their art
that material they could use best.&nbsp; They used it according
to their lights: Wycherley with a coarse and heavy hand, so that
it became nauseous; Etherege with a light touch and a gay
perception; Congreve with an instinct of good-breeding, with a
sure and extensive observation, and with an incomparable
style.&nbsp; But all were justified in choosing for their
material just what they chose.&nbsp; They sinned artistically,
now here, now there; but to complain of this old comedy as a
whole, that vice in it is crammed too closely, is to forget that
a play is a picture, not a photograph, of life&mdash;is life
arranged and coloured&mdash;and that comedy of manners is
composed of foibles or vices condensed and relieved by one
another.&nbsp; In so far as they overdid this work, the comic
writers were artistically at fault, and Jeremy Collier was a good
critic; but when he and his successors go beyond the artistic
objection, one takes leave to say, they misapprehend the thing
criticised.&nbsp; To complain that &lsquo;love&rsquo; and common
morality have no place in satiric comedy is either to contemplate
ridicule of them or to ask comedy to be other than satiric.&nbsp;
We know what happened when the dramatists gave way: there
followed, Hazlitt says, &lsquo;those <i>do-me-good</i>,
lack-a-daisical, whining, make-believe comedies in the next age,
which are enough to set one to sleep, and where the author tries
in vain to be merry and wise in the same breath.&rsquo;&nbsp;
These in place of &lsquo;the court, the gala day of wit and
pleasure, <!-- page xi--><a name="pagexi"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xi</span>of gallantry, and Charles the
Second!&rsquo; And all because people would not keep their
functions distinct, and remember that at a comedy they were in a
court of art and not in a court of law!&nbsp; The old comedy is
dead, and its spirit gone from the stage: I have but endeavoured
to show that no harm need come to our phylacteries, if a flame
start from its ashes in the printed book.</p>
<h3>II.</h3>
<p>William Congreve was born at Bardsey, near Leeds, and was
baptized on 10th February 1669 [1670].&nbsp; The Congreves were a
Staffordshire family, of an antiquity of four hundred years at
the date of the poet&rsquo;s birth.&nbsp; Richard, his
grandfather, was a redoubtable Cavalier, and William, his father,
an officer in the army.&nbsp; The latter was given a command at
Youghal, while his son was still an infant, and becoming shortly
afterwards agent to Lord Cork, removed to Lismore.&nbsp; So it
chanced that the poet had his schooling at Kilkenny (with Swift),
and proceeded to Trinity College, Dublin, in 1685, rejoining
Swift, and like his friend becoming a pupil of St. George Ashe,
the mathematician.&nbsp; In 1688 he left Dublin, remained with
his people in Staffordshire for some two years, entered himself
at the Temple, and came upon the town with <i>The Old
Bachelor</i> in January 1692.&nbsp; <i>The Double-Dealer</i> was
produced in November 1693.&nbsp; In 1694 a storm in the theatre
led to a secession of Betterton and other renowned players from
Drury Lane: with the result that a new playhouse was opened in
Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn Fields, on 30th April 1695, with <i>Love for
Love</i>.&nbsp; In the same year Congreve was appointed
&lsquo;Commissioner for Licensing Hackney Coaches.&rsquo;&nbsp;
<i>The Mourning Bride</i> was produced in 1697, and was followed,
oddly enough, by the controversy, or rather &lsquo;row,&rsquo;
with Jeremy Collier.&nbsp; In March 1700 came <i>The Way of the
World</i>.&nbsp; The poet was made Commissioner <!-- page
xii--><a name="pagexii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xii</span>of
Wine-Licences in 1705, and in 1714 with his Jamaica secretaryship
and his places in the Customs and the delightful
&lsquo;Pipe-Office,&rsquo; he had an income of twelve hundred
pounds a year.&nbsp; He died at his house in Surrey Street,
Strand, on 19th January 1728 [1729].</p>
<p>One or two comments on these dates are obvious.&nbsp; They
dissipate the Thackerayan fable that on the production of <i>The
Old Bachelor</i>, the fortunate young author received a shower of
sinecures, &lsquo;all for writing a comedy.&rsquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;And crazy Congreve scarce could spare<br />
A shilling to discharge a chair,&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>writes Swift, and &lsquo;crazy&rsquo; indicates that Congreve
was gouty before he was rich.&nbsp; But then, the gout was a very
early factor in his life, and one may call the line an
exaggeration.&nbsp; Another couplet:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Thus Congreve spent in writing plays,<br />
And one poor office, half his days:&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>probably expresses the truth.&nbsp; With his plays and his
hackney coaches he doubtless got through his twenties and
thirties with no very hardly grinding poverty, and at forty or so
was comfortably secure.&nbsp; But another fact, which the dates
bring out very sharply, has a different interest.&nbsp; At an age
when Swift was beginning to try his powers, Congreve&rsquo;s work
was done.&nbsp; A few odes, a few letters he was still to write,
but no more comedies.&nbsp; Was it ill-health? or because the
town had all but damned his greatest play? or because he cared
more for life than for art?</p>
<h3>III.</h3>
<p>The question brings one to an attempted appreciation of the
man.&nbsp; Mr. Gosse, for whose <i>Life</i> I would express my
gratitude, confesses that &lsquo;it is not very easy to construct
a <!-- page xiii--><a name="pagexiii"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xiii</span>definite portrait of
Congreve.&rsquo;&nbsp; But that it baffled that very new
journalist, Mrs. Manley, in his own day, and Mr. Gosse, with his
information, in ours, to give &lsquo;salient points&rsquo; to
Congreve&rsquo;s character, proves in itself an essential
characteristic, which need be negatively stated only by
choice.&nbsp; That no amusing eccentricities are recorded, no
ludicrous adventures, no persistent quarrels, implies, taken with
other facts we know, that he was a well-bred man of the world,
with the habit of society: that in itself is a definite personal
quality.&nbsp; One supposes him an ease-loving man, not inclined
to clown for the amusement of his world.&nbsp; He was loved by
his friends, being tolerant, and understanding the art of social
life.&nbsp; He was successful, and must therefore have had
enemies, but he was careless to improve hostilities.&nbsp; For
the temperament which is so plain in the best of his writings
must have been present in his life&mdash;an unobtrusive, because
a never directly implied, superiority and an ironical
humour.&nbsp; The picture of swaggering snobbishness which
Thackeray was inspired to make of him is proved bad by all that
we know.&nbsp; A swaggerer could not have made a fast friend of
Dryden&mdash;grown mellow, indeed, but by no means beggared of
his fire&mdash;on his first coming to town, nor kept the intimacy
of Swift, nor avoided the fault-finding of Dennis.&nbsp; It is
quite unnecessary to suppose that Congreve&rsquo;s famous remark
to Voltaire, that he wished to be visited as a plain gentleman,
was the remark (if it was made) of a snob: it was clearly a
legitimate deprecation, spoken by a man who had written nothing
notable for twenty-six years, which Voltaire misunderstood in a
moment of stupidity, or in one of forgetfulness
misrepresented.&nbsp; His superiority and his irony came from a
just sense of the perspective of things, and, not preventing
affection for his friends, left him indifferent to his
foes.&nbsp; Probably, also, a course of dissipation (at which
Swift hints) in his youth, acting on a temperament not
particularly ardent, had <!-- page xiv--><a
name="pagexiv"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xiv</span>left him
with such passions for war and love as were well under
control.&nbsp; The two women with whom his name is connected were
Mrs. Bracegirdle and the Duchess of Marlborough; but nobody
knew&mdash;though the latter&rsquo;s mother hinted the
worst&mdash;how far the intimacy went.&nbsp; That is to say, no
patent scandal was necessary to the connexion, if in either case
Congreve was a lover.&nbsp; And (once more) Congreve was a
gentleman.</p>
<p>But why did he become sterile at thirty?&nbsp; Where, if not
in dealing with motives and causes, may one be fancy-free?&nbsp;
Here there are many, of which the first to be given is mere
conjecture, but conjecture, I fancy, not inconsistent with such
facts as are known.&nbsp; When Congreve produced his first
comedy, he was but twenty-three, fresh from college and the
country, ignorant, as we are told, of the world.&nbsp; He
discovered very soon that he had an aptitude for social life,
that, no doubt, living humours and follies were as entertaining
as printed ones, that for a popular and witty man the world was
pleasant.&nbsp; But no man may be socially finished all at
once.&nbsp; In the course of the seven years between <i>The Old
Bachelor</i> and <i>The Way of the World</i>, Congreve must have
found his wit becoming readier, his tact surer, his appreciation
of natural comedy finer and (as personal keenness decreased) more
equable, his popularity greater, and&mdash;in fine&mdash;the
world more pleasant and the attractions of the study waning and
waning in comparison.&nbsp; He was a finished artist, he was
born, one might almost say, with a style; but his inclination was
to put his art into life rather than into print.&nbsp; Even in
our days (thank God for all His mercies!) everybody is not
writing a book.&nbsp; There are people whose talk has inimitable
touches, and whose lives are art, but who never sit down to a
quire of foolscap.&nbsp; I believe that Congreve naturally was
one of these, that his literary ambition was a result of
accidental necessity, and that had he lived as a boy in the
society he was of as a very young man&mdash;for all its literary
ornaments&mdash;we should have had <!-- page xv--><a
name="pagexv"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xv</span>of him only
odes and songs.&nbsp; His generation was idler and took itself
less seriously than ours.&nbsp; The primal curse was not imposed
on everybody as a duty.&nbsp; In seven years of growing
appreciation Congreve came to think the little graces and humours
the better part.&nbsp; That I believe to have been the first
cause of his early sterility; but others helped to determine the
effect.&nbsp; A certain indolence is of course implied in what
has been said.&nbsp; There was the gout, and there were his
unfortunate obesity and his failing sight.&nbsp; There was
Henrietta, Duchess of Marlborough, an absorbing dame.&nbsp; There
were the success of <i>Love for Love</i> and the failure of
<i>The Way of the World</i>.&nbsp; For all that may be said of
the indifference of the true artist to the verdict of the
many-headed beast&mdash;and Congreve&rsquo;s contempt was as fine
as any&mdash;it is not amusing when your play or your book falls
flat, and Congreve must have known that he might write another,
and possibly a better, <i>Way of the World</i>, but no more
<i>Love for Loves</i>.&nbsp; Not to anticipate a later division
of the subject, it may be said here that a man of thirty, of a
fine intellect and a fine taste, of a languid habit withal, and
with an invalided constitution, while he might repeat the
triumphs of diction and intellect of <i>The Way of the World</i>,
was most unlikely to return to the broader humours and the more
popular gaiety of the other play.&nbsp; Congreve, like Rochester
before him, despised the judgment of the town in these matters,
but by the town he would have to be judged.</p>
<p>He was a witty, handsome man of the world, of imperturbable
temper and infinite tact, who could make and keep the friendship
of very various men, and be intimate with a woman without
quarrelling with her lovers.&nbsp; He had a taste for pictures
and a love for music.&nbsp; He must have hated violence and
uproar, and liked the finer shades of life.&nbsp; He wore the
mode of his day, and was free from the superficial protests of
the narrow-minded.&nbsp; Possibly not a very &lsquo;definite
portrait,&rsquo; possibly a very <!-- page xvi--><a
name="pagexvi"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xvi</span>negative
characterisation.&nbsp; Possibly, also, a tolerably sure
foundation for a structure of sympathetic imagination.</p>
<h3>IV.</h3>
<p>Passing from necessarily vague and not obviously pertinent
remarks to criticism, which may fairly be less diffident, we
leave Congreve&rsquo;s life and come to his work, to his
&lsquo;tawdry playhouse taper,&rsquo; as Thackeray called
it.&nbsp; It is only after the man has appeared that we recognise
that he came at the hour; but the nature of the hour is in this
case not difficult to be discerned.&nbsp; The habit of playgoing
was well-established; the turmoil of the Revolution was over; De
Jure was at a comfortable distance, and De Facto&rsquo;s wife was
a patroness of the arts.&nbsp; But playgoers had but to be shown
something better than that they had, to discover that the
convention of the Restoration needed new blood.&nbsp; A
justification of its choice of material has been attempted: there
is no inconsistency in affirming that the tendency to use it with
a mere monotony of ribaldry was emphatic.&nbsp; Of this tendency
the most notable and useful illustration is Wycherley, because in
point of wit and dramatic skill he dwarfed his colleagues.&nbsp;
As Mr. Swinburne has said, the art of Congreve is different in
kind, not merely in degree, from the cruder and more boisterous
product of the &lsquo;brawny&rsquo; dramatist.&nbsp; Happily,
however, for his success, the difference was not instantly
clear.&nbsp; His first play links him with Wycherley, not with
that rare and faint embryo of the later Congreve, George
Etherege.&nbsp; &lsquo;You was always a gentleman, Mr.
George,&rsquo; as the valet says in <i>Beau Austin</i>.&nbsp;
Happily for his popularity Congreve first followed the more
popular man.&nbsp; It is not, indeed, until he wrote his last
play that he was a whole Etherege idealised, albeit a greater
than Etherege in the meantime.&nbsp; The peculiar effect which
Etherege achieved in <i>Sir Fopling Flutter</i>&mdash;at whom and
with whom you laugh at <!-- page xvii--><a
name="pagexvii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xvii</span>once&mdash;was not sublimated (the fineness left, the
faintness become firmness) until Congreve created Witwoud, the
inimitable, in <i>The Way of the World</i>.</p>
<p>At the very first Congreve had good fortune in his
players.&nbsp; It was a brave time for them.&nbsp; True, their
salaries were not wonderfully large.&nbsp; Colley Cibber
complains of the days before the revolt in 1694: &lsquo;at what
unequal salaries the hired actors were held by the absolute
authority of their frugal masters, the patentees.&rsquo;&nbsp;
But the example was not faded of those gay days when they were
the pets of the most artistic court that England has known: when
great ladies carried Kynaston in his woman&rsquo;s dress to Hyde
Park after the play, and the King was the most persistent and the
most interested playgoer in his realm.&nbsp; They were not thus
petted for irrelevant reasons&mdash;for their respectability,
their piety, or their domestic virtues; and their recognition as
artists by an artistic society did not spoil their art.&nbsp;
When Congreve started on his course of play-writing, Queen Mary
kept up, in a measure, the amiable custom of her uncle.&nbsp; He
was very fortunate in his casts.&nbsp; There was Betterton, first
of all, the versatile, the restrained, and, witness everybody,
the incomparable.&nbsp; There was Underhill, &lsquo;a correct and
natural comedian&rsquo;&mdash;one must quote Cibber pretty often
in this connexion&mdash;not well suited, one must suppose, to
play Setter to Betterton&rsquo;s Heartwell in <i>The Old
Bachelor</i>, but by reason of his admirable assumption of
stupidity to make an excellent Sir Sampson in <i>Love for
Love</i>.&nbsp; There were Powel, Williams, Verbruggen, Bowen,
and Dogget (Fondlewife in the first play: afterwards Ben Legend,
a part which made his fame and turned his head)&mdash;all notable
comedians.&nbsp; Kynaston, graceful in old age as he had been
beautiful in youth, was not in <i>The Old Bachelor</i>, but
created Lord Touchwood in <i>The Double-Dealer</i>.&nbsp;
Mountfort had been murdered by my Lord Mohun, and Leigh had
followed him to the grave, but their names lived in their <!--
page xviii--><a name="pagexviii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xviii</span>wives.&nbsp; Mrs. Mountfort &lsquo;was mistress of
more variety of humour than I ever knew in any one woman actress
. . . nothing, though ever so barren, if within the bounds of
nature, could be flat in her hands.&rsquo;&nbsp; Indeed
&lsquo;she was so fond of humour, in what low part soever to be
found, that she would make no scruple of defacing her fair form
to come heartily into it&rsquo;&mdash;assuredly a rare
actress!&nbsp; About Mrs. Leigh Cibber is less enthusiastic, but
grants her &lsquo;a good deal of humour&rsquo;: her old women
were famous.&nbsp; Mrs. Barry was a stately, dignified actress,
best, no doubt, in tragedy.&nbsp; Lastly, there was Mrs.
Bracegirdle, the innocent <i>publica cura</i>, whom authors
courted through their plays, and who had all the men in the house
for longing lovers.&nbsp; Who shall say how far &lsquo;her youth
and lively aspect&rsquo; influenced the criticisms that have come
down to us?&nbsp; She played Millamant to Congreve&rsquo;s
satisfaction.</p>
<h3>V.</h3>
<p>It is not difficult to understand how it was that Dryden
thought <i>The Old Bachelor</i> the best first play he had seen,
and the town applauded to the echo.&nbsp; But it is a little hard
to understand why later critics, with the three other comedies
before them, have not more expressly marked the difference
between the first and those.&nbsp; There is no new tune in <i>The
Old Bachelor</i>: it is an old tune more finely played, and for
that very reason it met with immediate acceptance.&nbsp; It is
not likely that Dryden&mdash;a great poet and a great and
generous critic, it may be, but an old man&mdash;would have
bestowed such unhesitating approval on a play which ignored the
conventions in which he had lived.&nbsp; As it was, he saw those
conventions reverently followed, yet served by a master
wit.&nbsp; The fact that Congreve allowed Dryden and others to
&lsquo;polish&rsquo; his play, by giving it an air of the stage
and the town which it lacked, need not of course spoil it for
us.&nbsp; The stamp of Congreve is clearly marked on <!-- page
xix--><a name="pagexix"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xix</span>the dialogue, though not on every page.&nbsp; You may
see its essentials in two passages taken absolutely at
random.&nbsp; &lsquo;Come, come,&rsquo; says Bellmour in the very
first scene, &lsquo;leave business to idlers and wisdom to fools;
they have need of &rsquo;em: wit be my faculty and pleasure my
occupation, and let Father Time shake his glass.&rsquo;&nbsp; Or
Fondlewife soliloquises: &lsquo;Tell me, Isaac, why art thee
jealous?&nbsp; Why art thee distrustful of the wife of thy
bosom?&nbsp; Because she is young and vigorous, and I am old and
impotent.&nbsp; Then why didst thee marry, Isaac?&nbsp; Because
she was beautiful and tempting, and because I was obstinate and
doating. . . .&rsquo;&nbsp; In the one passage is the gay and
skilfully light paradox, in the other the clean, rhythmical, and
balanced, yet dramatic and appropriate English that are elements
of Congreve&rsquo;s style.&nbsp; It is in the conventions of its
characterisation that <i>The Old Bachelor</i> belongs, not to
true Congrevean comedy but, to that of the models from which he
was to break away.&nbsp; The characterisation of <i>The Way of
the World</i> is light and true, that of <i>The Old Bachelor</i>
is heavy and yet vague.&nbsp; Vainlove indeed, the &lsquo;mumper
in love,&rsquo; who &lsquo;lies canting at the gate,&rsquo; is
individual and Congrevean.&nbsp; But Heartwell, the blustering
fool, Bellmour, the impersonal rake, Wittol and Bluffe, the
farcical sticks, Fondlewife, the immemorial city husband, and the
troop of undistinguished women&mdash;what can be said of them but
that they are glaring stage properties, speaking better English
than the comic stage had before attracted?&nbsp; Germs, possibly,
of better things to come, that is all, so far as characterisation
goes.&nbsp; The Fondlewife episode, in particular, which
doubtless was mightily popular&mdash;what is there more in it
than the mutton fisted wit and brutality of Wycherley, with some
of Congreve&rsquo;s English?&nbsp; Such scenes as these, it may
be hazarded, so contemptible in the light of Congreve&rsquo;s
better work, are ineffective now because they fall between two
stools: between the comedy (or tragedy) of a crude physical fact,
naked and <!-- page xx--><a name="pagexx"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xx</span>impossible, as in Rochester, and the
comedy (or tragedy) of delicately-phrased intrigue.&nbsp; The
latter was yet to come when this play was produced, and meantime
such episodes went very well, and their popularity is
intelligible.&nbsp; For the rest <i>The Old Bachelor</i>, though
to us in these days its plot appear a somewhat uninspiring piece
of fairyland, was a good acting play, fitted with great skill to
its actual players.&nbsp; The part of Fondlewife, created by
Dogget, was on a revival played (to his own immense satisfaction)
by Colley Cibber.&nbsp; In Araminta Mrs. Bracegirdle began (in a
faint outline as it were) the series of lively, sympathetic,
intelligent heroines which Congreve wrote for her.&nbsp; Lord
Falkland&rsquo;s Prologue is as funny as it is indecently
suggestive, which is saying a great deal.&nbsp; The one actually
spoken gave an opportunity of the merriest archness to Mrs.
Bracegirdle, and was calculated to put the audience in the best
of good humours.</p>
<p>The faults of <i>The Double-Dealer</i> are obvious on a first
reading, and were very justly condemned on a first acting.&nbsp;
The intrigue is wearisome: its involutions are ineffectively
puzzling.&nbsp; Maskwell&rsquo;s villainy and Mellefont&rsquo;s
folly are both unconvincing.&nbsp; The tragedy of Lady Touchwood,
less tragic than that of Lady Wishfort in <i>The Way of the
World</i>, is more obviously than that out of the picture.&nbsp;
The play is, in fact, not pure comedy of manners: it is that
<i>plus</i> tragedy, an element less offensive than the
sentimentality which spoils <i>The School for Scandal</i>, but
yet a notable fault.&nbsp; For while you can resolve the tragedy
of Lady Wishfort into wicked and very grim comedy, you can do
nothing with the tragedy of Lady Touchwood but try to ignore
it.&nbsp; In his epistle dedicatory to Charles Montague, Congreve
admits that his play has faults, but does not take in hand those
adduced above, with the exception of the objections to Maskwell
and Mellefont.&nbsp; &lsquo;They have mistaken cunning in one
character for folly in another&rsquo;: an ineffectual answer,
because the extremity <!-- page xxi--><a name="pagexxi"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xxi</span>of cunning is equally destructive of
dramatic balance.&nbsp; He defends his use of soliloquy very
warmly: of which it may be said that, so long as his
rule&mdash;that no character may overhear the
soliloquiser&mdash;is observed, it is a tolerable convention, but
a confession of weakness in construction.&nbsp; He declares he
&lsquo;would rather disoblige all the critics in the world than
one of the fair sex,&rsquo; and, having made his bow, he turns
upon the ladies and rends them.&nbsp; An author campaigning
against his critics is always a pleasant spectacle, but
Congreve&rsquo;s defence of <i>The Double-Dealer</i> is rather
amusing than convincing.</p>
<p>It needed no defence; for with all its faults, such as they
are, upon it, there are in it scenes and characters which only
Congreve could have made.&nbsp; Brisk is a worthy forerunner of
Witwoud, Sir Paul Plyant a delicious old credulous fool; while
the tyrannical and vain Lady Plyant is so drawn that you almost
love her.&nbsp; But the triumph is Lady Froth, &lsquo;a great
coquet, pretender to poetry, wit, and learning,&rsquo; and one
would almost as lief have seen Mrs. Mountfort in the part as the
Bracegirdle&rsquo;s Millamant.&nbsp; Her serious folly and
foolish wisdom, her poem and malice and compliments and babbling
vivacity&mdash;set off, it is fair to remember, by a pretty
face&mdash;are atonement for a dozen Maskwells.&nbsp; She is a
female Witwoud, her author&rsquo;s first success in a sort of
character he draws to perfection.&nbsp; The scene between
Mellefont and Lady Plyant, where she insists on believing that
the gallant, under cover of a marriage with her stepdaughter,
purposes to lead her astray, and where she goes through a
delightful farce of answering her scruples before the bewildered
man&mdash;the scene that for some far-fetched reason led
Macaulay&rsquo;s mind to the incest in the <i>Oedipus
Rex</i>&mdash;is perhaps the best comedy of situation in the
piece.&nbsp; But the scene of defamation between the Froths and
Brisk is notable as (with the Cabal idea in <i>The Way of the
World</i>) the inspiration of the Scandal Scenes in <!-- page
xxii--><a name="pagexxii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xxii</span>Sheridan&rsquo;s play.&nbsp; When we remember that
less than two years were gone since the production of <i>The Old
Bachelor</i>, the improvement in Congreve is remarkable.&nbsp;
Almost his only concession to the groundlings is the star-gazing
episode of Lady Froth and Brisk: a mistake, because it spoils her
inconsequent folly, but a small matter.&nbsp; In his second play
Congreve was himself, the wittiest and most polished writer of
comedy in English.&nbsp; In the face of this fact &lsquo;the
public&rsquo; conducted itself characteristically: it more or
less damned <i>The Double-Dealer</i> until the queen approved,
when it applauded lustily.&nbsp; That occasion gave Colley Cibber
his first chance as Kynaston&rsquo;s substitute in Lord
Touchwood.&nbsp; When one remembers Dryden&rsquo;s long,
struggling, cudgelling and cudgelled life, it is impossible to
read without emotion his tribute to a very young and successful
author in the verses prefixed to this play:</p>
<blockquote><p>Firm Doric pillars found your solid base:<br />
The fair Corinthian crowns the higher space;<br />
Thus all below is strength, and all above is grace.<br />
. . . . .<br />
We cannot envy you, because we love.<br />
. . . . .<br />
Time, place, and action may with pains be wrought,<br />
But Genius must be born, and never can be taught.<br />
This is your portion, this your native store;<br />
Heav&rsquo;n, that but once was prodigal before.<br />
To Shakespeare gave as much; she could not give him more.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The tribute is indubitably sincere; in point of
Congreve&rsquo;s wit and diction it is as indubitably true.</p>
<p><i>Love for Love</i> was the most popular of Congreve&rsquo;s
comedies: it held the stage so long that Hazlitt could say,
&lsquo;it still acts and is still acted well.&rsquo;&nbsp; Being
wise after the event, one may give some obvious reasons.&nbsp; It
is more human than any other of his plays, and at the same time
more farcical.&nbsp; By &lsquo;more human&rsquo; it is not meant
that the characters are truer to life than those in <!-- page
xxiii--><a name="pagexxiii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xxiii</span><i>The Way of the World</i>, but that they are truer
to average life, and therefore more easily recognisable by the
average spectator.&nbsp; Tattle, for instance, is so gross a
fool, that any fool in the pit could see his folly; Witwoud might
deceive all but the elect.&nbsp; No familiarity&mdash;direct or
indirect&mdash;with a particular mode of life and speech is
necessary to the appreciation of <i>Love for Love</i>.&nbsp; Sir
Sampson Legend is your unmistakable heavy father, cross-grained
and bullying.&nbsp; Valentine is no ironical, fine gentleman like
Mirabell, but a young rake from Cambridge, all debts and high
spirits.&nbsp; Scandal is a plain railer at things, especially
women; Ben Legend a sea-dog who cannot speak without a nautical
metaphor; Jeremy an idealised comic servant; and Foresight
grotesque farce.&nbsp; Angelica is a shrewd but hearty
&lsquo;English girl,&rsquo; and Miss Prue a veritable country
Miss; while Mrs. Frail and Mrs. Foresight are broadly skittish
matrons.&nbsp; There is nothing in the play to strain the
attention or to puzzle the intellect, and it is full of laughter:
no wonder it was a success.&nbsp; It is, intellectually, on an
altogether different plane from <i>The Way of the World</i>, on a
slightly lower one than <i>The Double-Dealer</i>.&nbsp; But in
its own way it is irresistibly funny, and by reason of its
diction it is never for a moment other than distinguished.</p>
<p>I imagine the bodkin scene will always take the palm in it for
mere mirth.&nbsp; Delightful sisters!</p>
<blockquote><p>I suppose you would not go alone to the
World&rsquo;s End?</p>
<p>The World&rsquo;s End!&nbsp; What, do you mean to banter
me?</p>
<p>Poor innocent!&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t know that there&rsquo;s a
place called the World&rsquo;s End?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll swear you
can keep your countenance purely; you&rsquo;d make an admirable
player. . . . But look you here, now&mdash;where did you lose
this gold bodkin?&mdash;Oh, sister, sister!</p>
<p>My bodkin?</p>
<p>Nay, &rsquo;tis yours; look at it.</p>
<p>Well, if you go to that, where did you find this bodkin?&nbsp;
Oh, sister, sister!&mdash;sister every way.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page xxiv--><a name="pagexxiv"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xxiv</span>Broad, popular comedy, it is
admirable; but it is not especially Congrevean.&nbsp;
Tattle&rsquo;s love-lesson to Miss Prue and his boasting of his
duchesses are in the same broad vein.&nbsp; Valentine&rsquo;s mad
scene is more remarkable, in that Congreve gives rein to his
fancy, and that his diction is at its very best.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Hark&rsquo;ee, I have a secret to tell you.&nbsp; Endymion
and the Moon shall meet us upon Mount Latmos, and will be married
in the dead of night.&nbsp; But say not a word.&nbsp; Hymen shall
put his torch into a dark lanthorn, that it may be secret; and
Juno shall give her peacock poppy-water, that he may fold his
ogling tail, and Argus&rsquo;s hundred eyes be shut, ha?&nbsp;
Nobody shall know, but Jeremy.&rsquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>TATTLE.&nbsp; Do you know me, Valentine?</p>
<p>VALENTINE.&nbsp; You?&nbsp; Who are you?&nbsp; No, I hope
not.</p>
<p>TATTLE.&nbsp; I am Jack Tattle, your friend.</p>
<p>VALENTINE.&nbsp; My friend, what to do?&nbsp; I am no married
man, and thou canst not lie with my wife.&nbsp; I am very poor,
and thou canst not borrow money of me.&nbsp; Then, what
employment have I for a friend?</p>
<p>ANGELICA.&nbsp; Do you know me, Valentine?</p>
<p>VALENTINE.&nbsp; Oh, very well.</p>
<p>ANGELICA.&nbsp; Who am I?</p>
<p>VALENTINE.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re a woman, one to whom Heaven gave
beauty when it grafted roses on a briar.&nbsp; You are the
reflection of Heaven in a pond, and he that leaps at you is
sunk.&nbsp; You are all white, a sheet of lovely, spotless paper,
when you first are born; but you are to be scrawled and blotted
by every goose&rsquo;s quill.&nbsp; I know you; for I loved a
woman, and loved her so long, that I found out a strange thing: I
found out what a woman was good for.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Imagine Betterton, the greatest actor of his time, delivering
that last speech, with its incomparable rhythm!&nbsp; I like to
think that he gave the spectators an idea that Valentine&rsquo;s
self-sacrifice for Angelica was nothing but a bold device, a
calculated effect; otherwise the sacrifice is an excrescence in
this comedy, which, popular and broad though it be, is cynical in
Congreve&rsquo;s manner throughout.&nbsp; One is consoled,
however, by the pleasant <!-- page xxv--><a
name="pagexxv"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xxv</span>fate of the
ingenious Mr. Tattle and the intriguing Mrs. Frail, who are left
tied for life against their will.&nbsp; The trick, by the way, of
a tricked marriage is constant in Congreve, and reveals his
poverty of construction.&nbsp; He can devise you comic situations
unflaggingly, but when he approaches the end of a play his
<i>deus ex machin&acirc;</i> is invariably this flattest and most
battered old deity in fairyland.</p>
<p>The dedication to Lord Dorset contains nothing of interest
beyond the confession that the play is too long, and the
information that part of it was omitted in the playing.&nbsp; A
line in the prologue, &lsquo;We grieve One falling Adam and one
tempted Eve,&rsquo; is explained by Colley Cibber to refer to
Mrs. Mountford, who, having cast her lot with Betterton and
migrated to Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn Fields, threw up her part on a
question of cash, and to Williams, an actor who &lsquo;loved his
bottle better than his business,&rsquo; who deserted at the same
time.&nbsp; It serves to show the interest the town took in the
players, that the fact was referred to on the stage.&nbsp; The
lady&rsquo;s part was taken by Mrs. Ayliff; Mrs. Leigh played the
nurse&mdash;a very poor part after Lady Plyant; Dogget&rsquo;s
success as Ben Legend has been noted.&nbsp; Mrs.
Bracegirdle&rsquo;s Angelica was doubtless ravishing: a
&lsquo;virtuous young woman,&rsquo; as our ancestors phrased it,
but quite relieved from insipidity.</p>
<p>It would need a greater presumption than the writer is gifted
withal to add his contribution to the praises critics have
lavished on <i>The Way of the World</i>.&nbsp; It is better to
quote Mr. Swinburne.&nbsp; &lsquo;In 1700 Congreve replied to
Collier with the crowning work of his genius&mdash;the unequalled
and unapproached masterpiece of English comedy.&nbsp; The one
play in our language which may fairly claim a place beside, or
but just beneath, the mightiest work of Moli&egrave;re, is <i>The
Way of the World</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp; But he continues: &lsquo;On
the stage, which had recently acclaimed with uncritical applause
the author&rsquo;s more questionable appearance <!-- page
xxvi--><a name="pagexxvi"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xxvi</span>in the field of tragedy,&rsquo;&mdash;<i>The Mourning
Bride</i>,&mdash;&lsquo;this final and flawless evidence of his
incomparable powers met with a rejection then and ever since
inexplicable on any ground of conjecture.&rsquo;&nbsp; There the
critics are not unanimous.&nbsp; Mr. Gosse, for instance, has his
explanation: that the spectators must have fidgeted, and wished
&lsquo;that the actors and actresses would be doing
something.&rsquo;&nbsp; Very like, indeed: the spectators, then
as now, would no doubt have preferred &lsquo;knock-about
farce.&rsquo;&nbsp; But, I venture to think, the explanation is
not complete.&nbsp; The construction of the play is weak,
certainly, but the actors and actresses do a great deal after
all.&nbsp; For that matter, audiences will stand scenes of still
wit&mdash;but they like to comprehend it; and the characters in
<i>The Way of the World</i>, or most of them, represent a society
whose attitude and speech are entirely ironical and paradoxical,
a society of necessity but a small fraction of any
community.&nbsp; Some sort of study or some special experience is
necessary to the enjoyment of such a set.&nbsp; It is not the
case of a few witticisms and paradoxes firing off at intervals,
like crackers, from the mouths of one or two actors with whom the
audience is taught to laugh as a matter of course: the vein is
unbroken.&nbsp; Now, literalness and common sense are the
qualities of the average uninstructed spectator, and <i>The Way
of the World</i> was high over the heads of its audience.</p>
<p>To come to details.&nbsp; The tragedy of Lady Wishfort has
often been remarked&mdash;the veritable tragedy of a lovesick old
woman.&nbsp; All the grotesque touches, her credulity, her
vanity, her admirable dialect (&lsquo;as I&rsquo;m a
person!&rsquo;), but serve to make the tragedy the more
pitiable.&nbsp; Either, therefore, our appreciation of satiric
comedy is defective, or Congreve made a mistake.&nbsp; To regard
this poor old soul as mere comedy is to attain to an almost
satanic height of contempt: the comedy is more than grim, it is
savagely cruel.&nbsp; To be pitiless, on the other hand, is a
satirist&rsquo;s virtue.&nbsp; On the whole, we may reasonably
<!-- page xxvii--><a name="pagexxvii"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xxvii</span>say that the tragedy is not too
keen in itself, but that it is too obviously indicated.&nbsp;
Witwoud is surely a great character?&nbsp; The stage is alive
with mirth when he is on it.&nbsp; His entrance in the very first
part of the play is delightful.&nbsp; &lsquo;Afford me your
compassion, my dears; pity me, Fainall; Mirabell, pity me. . . .
Fainall, how does your lady?&nbsp; Gad, I say anything in the
world to get this fellow out of my head.&nbsp; I beg pardon that
I should ask a man of pleasure, and the town, a question at once
so foreign and domestic.&nbsp; But I talk like an old maid at a
marriage, I don&rsquo;t know what I say.&rsquo;&nbsp; But one
might quote for ever.&nbsp; Witwoud, almost as much as Millamant
herself, is an eternal type.&nbsp; His little exclamations, his
assurance of sympathy, his terror of the commonplace&mdash;surely
one knows them well?&nbsp; His tolerance of any impertinence,
lest he should be thought to have misunderstood a jest, is a
great distinction.&nbsp; But Congreve&rsquo;s gibe in the
dedication at the critics, who failed &lsquo;to distinguish
betwixt the character of a Witwoud and a Truewit,&rsquo; is
hardly fair: as Dryden said of Etherege&rsquo;s Sir Fopling, he
is &lsquo;a fool so nicely writ, The ladies might mistake him for
a wit.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then, Millamant is the ultimate expression of
those who, having all the material goods which nature and
civilisation can give, live on paradoxes and artifices.&nbsp; Her
insolence is the inoffensive insolence only possible to the
well-bred.&nbsp; &lsquo;O ay, letters,&mdash;I had
letters,&mdash;I am persecuted with letters,&mdash;I hate
letters,&mdash;nobody knows how to write letters; and yet one has
&rsquo;em, one does not know why,&mdash;they serve one to pin up
one&rsquo;s hair.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Beauty the lover&rsquo;s
gift!&mdash;Lord, what is a lover, that it can give?&nbsp; Why
one makes lovers as fast as one pleases, and they live as long as
one pleases, and they die as soon as one pleases; and then if one
pleases one makes more.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In parts of its characterisation <i>The Way of the World</i>
is extremely bold in observation, extremely careless of literary
<!-- page xxviii--><a name="pagexxviii"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xxviii</span>types and traditions.&nbsp; Mrs.
Fainall, a woman who is the friend, and assists in the intrigues,
of a man who has ceased to be her lover, is most unconventionally
human.&nbsp; Of all the inimitable scenes, that in which
Millamant and Mirabell make their conditions of marriage is
perhaps the most unquestionable triumph.&nbsp; &lsquo;Let us
never visit together, nor go to a play together, but let us be
very strange and well-bred&rsquo;&mdash;there is its
keynote.&nbsp; The dialogue is as sure and perfect in diction, in
balance of phrases, and in musical effectiveness as can be
conceived, and for all its care is absolutely free in its
gaiety.&nbsp; It is the ultimate expression of the joys of the
artificial.&nbsp; As for the prologue, it is an invitation to the
dullards to damn the play, and is anything but serenely
confident.&nbsp; The dedication, to &lsquo;Ralph, Earl of
Mountague,&rsquo; has an interesting fact: it tells us that the
comedy was written immediately after staying with him, &lsquo;in
your retirement last summer from the town,&rsquo; and pays a
tribute to the influence of the society the dramatist met
there.&nbsp; &lsquo;Vous y voyez partout,&rsquo; said Voltaire of
Congreve, &lsquo;le langage des honn&ecirc;tes gens avec des
actions de fripon; ce qui prouve qu&rsquo;il connaissait bien son
monde, et qu&rsquo;il vivait dans ce qu&rsquo;on appelle la bonne
compagnie.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The want of dramatic skill which has been alleged against
Congreve is simply a question of construction&mdash;of the
construction of his plays as a whole.&nbsp; His plots hang fire,
are difficult to follow, and are not worth remembering.&nbsp; But
many things besides go to the making of good plays, and few
playwrights have had all the theatrical virtues.&nbsp; Do we not
pardon a lack of incident in a novel of character?&nbsp; In this
connexion it is worth while to contrast Congreve with Sheridan,
who in the matter of construction was a far abler
craftsman.&nbsp; But is there not in the elder poet enough to
turn the scale, even the theatrical scale, ten times over?&nbsp;
Compare the petty indignation, with which the dramatist of <i>The
School for Scandal</i> deals with <!-- page xxix--><a
name="pagexxix"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xxix</span>his
scandalmongers, and the amused indifference of Congreve towards
the cabalists in <i>The Way of the World</i>.&nbsp; Or take any
hero of Congreve&rsquo;s and contrast him with that glorification
of vulgar lavishness and canting generosity, that very
barmaid&rsquo;s hero, Charles Surface.&nbsp; It is all very well
to say that Joseph is the real hero; but Sheridan made it natural
for the stupid sentimentality of later days to make him the
villain, and Congreve would have made it impossible.&nbsp; Of wit
(of course) there is more in a scene of Congreve than in a play
of Sheridan.&nbsp; Moreover, faulty in construction as his main
plots are, in detail his construction is often admirable: as in
play of character upon character, in countless opportunities for
delightful archness and cruelty in the women, for the display of
every comic emotion in the men.&nbsp; He lived in the playhouse,
and his characters, true to life though they be, have about them
as it were an ideal essence of the boards.&nbsp; With Hazlitt,
&lsquo;I would rather have seen Mrs. Abington&rsquo;s Millamant
than any Rosalind that ever appeared on the stage.&rsquo;&nbsp; A
lover and a constant frequenter of the theatre&mdash;albeit the
plays he sees bore him to death&mdash;cannot, in reading
Congreve, choose but see the glances and hear the intonations of
imaginary players.</p>
<h3>VI.</h3>
<p>Congreve&rsquo;s choice of material has been defended at an
early stage of these remarks.&nbsp; There is the further and more
interesting question of his point of view, his attitude towards
it.&nbsp; Mr. Henley speaks of his &lsquo;deliberate and
unmitigable baseness of morality.&rsquo;&nbsp; Differing with
deference, I think it may be shown that his attitude is a pose
merely, and an artistic and quite innocent pose.&nbsp; It is the
amusing pose of the boyish cynic turned into an artistic
convention.&nbsp; The lines:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;He alone won&rsquo;t betray in whom none
will confide,<br />
And the nymph may be chaste that has never been tried:&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page xxx--><a name="pagexxx"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xxx</span>which conclude the characteristic song in the third act
of <i>Love for Love</i>, are typical of his attitude.&nbsp; Does
anybody suppose that an intelligent man of the world meant that
sentiment in all seriousness?</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Nothing&rsquo;s new besides our faces,<br
/>
Every woman is the same&rsquo;&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>those lines (in his first play), which seemed so shocking to
Thackeray, what more do they express than the green cynicism of
youth?&nbsp; When Mr. Leslie Stephen speaks of his &lsquo;gush of
cynical sentiment,&rsquo; he speaks unsympathetically, but the
phrase, to be an enemy&rsquo;s, is just.&nbsp; It is cynical
sentiment, and the hostility comes from taking it
seriously.&nbsp; I think it the most artistic attitude for a
writer of gay, satiric comedies, and that its very excess should
prevent its being taken for more than a convention.&nbsp; We are
not called upon to see satiric comedies all day long, and the
question, everlastingly asked by implication of every work of
art&mdash;&lsquo;Would you like to live with it?&rsquo;&mdash;is
here, as in most other cases, irrelevant.&nbsp; One is reminded
that there is more in life than intrigues and cynical comments on
them.&nbsp; And one is inclined to put the questions in answer:
&lsquo;Does a man who really feels the sorrowful things of life,
its futile endeavours and piteous separations, find relief in
seeing his emotions mimicked on the stage in a
&lsquo;wholesome&rsquo; play of sentiment with a happy
ending?&nbsp; Is he not rather comforted by the distractions of
cheerful frivolity, of conventional denial of his
pains?&rsquo;&nbsp; The demand is as inartistic and irrelevant as
the criticism which suggested it, but it returns a sufficient
reply.&nbsp; It does not touch the &lsquo;catharsis&rsquo; of
tragedy, which is another matter.&nbsp; For the rest,
Congreve&rsquo;s attitude, cynicism apart, is an attitude of
irony and superiority over common emotions, the attitude,
artificial and inoffensive, of the society he depicts in his
greatest play.&nbsp; He enjoys the humours of his puppets, he
<!-- page xxxi--><a name="pagexxxi"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xxxi</span>is never angry with them.&nbsp; It is the attitude of
an artist in expounding human nature, of an expert in observation
of life: an attitude attainable but by very few, and disliked as
a rule by the rest, who want to clap or to hiss&mdash;who can
laugh but who cannot smile.</p>
<h3>VII.</h3>
<p>When Congreve left the stage, said Dennis the critic,
&lsquo;comedy left it with him.&rsquo;&nbsp; Vanburgh and
Farquhar were left to expound comedy of manners, the one with a
vigorous gusto, the other with a romantic gaiety.&nbsp; The
peculiar perfume of <i>The Way of the World</i> was given to
neither, yet they wrote comedy of manners.&nbsp; But if Congreve
left colleagues, he left no sons, and most certainly, one may
say, that when those colleagues died, English comedy took to her
bed.&nbsp; &lsquo;The Comic Muse, long sick, is now
a-dying,&rsquo; wrote Garrick in his prologue to <i>She Stoops to
Conquer</i>, and she had not to apologise, like Charles the
Second, for the unconscionable time she was about it.&nbsp; It is
a little crude to attribute her demise to Jeremy Collier and his
<i>Short View</i>&mdash;a block painted to look like a
thunderbolt.&nbsp; It is not a matter of decency, of alteration
or improvement in manners.&nbsp; A comedy might be wholly
Congrevean without a coarse word from beginning to end.&nbsp; It
is a matter of the exclusion (not the stultification), the
suspension of moral prepossessions, the absence of sympathetic
sentimentalism, the habit of shirking nothing and smiling at all
things.&nbsp; These qualities are not characteristic of the
average Englishman.&nbsp; Now, satiric comedy did not in its
initiation depend upon the average Englishman.&nbsp; It took its
cue from the court of Charles the Second, who&mdash;with a dash
of thoroughly English humour&mdash;was more than half-French in
temperament, and attracted to himself all that was artistically
frivolous in his kingdom.&nbsp; Questions of decency and
morality&mdash;<!-- page xxxii--><a name="pagexxxii"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xxxii</span>which after all are not
perpetually amusing&mdash;apart, the social spirit typified in
this exceptional king is one of sceptical humour and ironical
smiles: it takes common emotions for granted&mdash;is bored by
them, in fact&mdash;and is a foe to sentimentality and gush and
virtuously happy endings.&nbsp; It was the spirit of Charles the
Second that inspired English comedy, and inspired it most
thoroughly in Congreve but a few years after Charles&rsquo;s
death.&nbsp; Under changed conditions, one is apt to
underestimate the influence of the Court upon the Town two
hundred years ago.&nbsp; Well, the Georges became our defenders
of the faith, and they hated &lsquo;boets and
bainters.&rsquo;&nbsp; English comedy was thrown back upon the
patronage and the inspiration of average England, and up to the
time of writing has shown few signs of recovery.&nbsp; Of course,
the decay was gradual: you may see it at a most interesting stage
in <i>The School for Scandal</i>, a comedy of manners with a
strong dash of common sentimentality.&nbsp; It would be just
possible, one conceives, to play <i>The School for Scandal</i> as
Charles Lamb says he saw it played, with Joseph for a hero, as a
comedy of manners: you can just imagine Sir Peter as a sort of
Sir Paul Plyant, and as not played to raise a lump in your
throat.&nbsp; But Sheridan made it a difficult task.&nbsp;
Perhaps you may see the evil influence at its worst in the
so-called comedies which were our glory twenty-five years ago: in
such a play as <i>Caste</i>, an even river of sloppy sentiment,
where the acme of chivalrous delicacy is to refrain from lighting
a cigarette in a woman&rsquo;s presence, where the triumph of
humour is for a guardsman to take a kettle off the fire, and
where the character of Eccles shows what excellent comedy the
author might (alas!) have written.</p>
<p>One is fain to ask if the spirit of Congrevean comedy will
ever come back to our stage.&nbsp; An echo of it has been heard
in dialogue once or twice in the last few years: not a trace has
<!-- page xxxiii--><a name="pagexxxiii"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xxxiii</span>been seen in action.&nbsp; And
yet we permit our dramatists a pretty wide range of
subjects.&nbsp; We allow the subjects: it is the Congrevean
attitude towards them which we should condemn.&nbsp; But the
stage would be all the merrier if we could only understand that
that attitude is harmless; that to see the humorous aspect of a
thing is not to ignore the pathetic or the sociological; and that
we should return all the heartier to our serious and sentimental
considerations of the problems of life for allowing them to be
laughed at for an evening at a comedy.&nbsp; Meantime we can read
the book.</p>

<h3>TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE CHARLES, LORD CLIFFORD OF
LANESBOROUGH, etc.</h3>
<p>My Lord,&mdash;It is with a great deal of pleasure that I lay
hold on this first occasion which the accidents of my life have
given me of writing to your lordship: for since at the same time
I write to all the world, it will be a means of publishing (what
I would have everybody know) the respect and duty which I owe and
pay to you.&nbsp; I have so much inclination to be yours that I
need no other engagement.&nbsp; But the particular ties by which
I am bound to your lordship and family have put it out of my
power to make you any compliment, since all offers of myself will
amount to no more than an honest acknowledgment, and only shew a
willingness in me to be grateful.</p>
<p>I am very near wishing that it were not so much my interest to
be your lordship&rsquo;s servant, that it might be more my merit;
not that I would avoid being obliged to you, but I would have my
own choice to run me into the debt: that I might have it to
boast, I had distinguished a man to whom I would be glad to be
obliged, even without the hopes of having it in my power ever to
make him a return.</p>
<p>It is impossible for me to come near your lordship in any kind
and not to receive some favour; and while in appearance I am only
making an acknowledgment (with the usual underhand dealing of the
world) I am at the same time insinuating my own interest.&nbsp; I
cannot give your lordship your due, without tacking a bill of my
own privileges.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis true, if a man never committed a
folly, he would never stand in need of a protection.&nbsp; But
then power would have nothing to do, and good nature no occasion
to show itself; and where those qualities are, &rsquo;tis pity
they should want objects to shine upon.&nbsp; I must confess this
is no reason why a man should do an idle thing, nor indeed any
good excuse for it when done; yet it reconciles the uses of such
authority and goodness to the necessities of our follies, and is
a sort of poetical logic, which at this time I would make use of,
to argue your lordship into a protection of this play.&nbsp; It
is the first offence I have committed in this kind, or indeed, in
any kind of poetry, though not the first made public, and
therefore I hope will the more easily be pardoned.&nbsp; But had
it been acted, when it was first written, more might have been
said in its behalf: ignorance of the town and stage would then
have been excuses in a young writer, which now almost four
years&rsquo; experience will scarce allow of.&nbsp; Yet I must
declare myself sensible of the good nature of the town, in
receiving this play so kindly, with all its faults, which I must
own were, for the most part, very industriously covered by the
care of the players; for I think scarce a character but received
all the advantage it would admit of from the justness of the
action.</p>
<p>As for the critics, my lord, I have nothing to say to, or
against, any of them of any kind: from those who make just
exceptions, to those who find fault in the wrong place.&nbsp; I
will only make this general answer in behalf of my play (an
answer which Epictetus advises every man to make for himself to
his censurers), viz.: &lsquo;That if they who find some faults in
it, were as intimate with it as I am, they would find a great
many more.&rsquo;&nbsp; This is a confession, which I needed not
to have made; but however, I can draw this use from it to my own
advantage: that I think there are no faults in it but what I do
know; which, as I take it, is the first step to an amendment.</p>
<p>Thus I may live in hopes (sometime or other) of making the
town amends; but you, my lord, I never can, though I am ever your
lordship&rsquo;s most obedient and most humble servant,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">WILL. CONGREVE.</p>
<h3>TO MR. CONGREVE.</h3>
<p>When virtue in pursuit of fame appears,<br />
And forward shoots the growth beyond the years.<br />
We timely court the rising hero&rsquo;s cause,<br />
And on his side the poet wisely draws,<br />
Bespeaking him hereafter by applause.<br />
The days will come, when we shall all receive<br />
Returning interest from what now we give,<br />
Instructed and supported by that praise<br />
And reputation which we strive to raise.<br />
Nature so coy, so hardly to be wooed,<br />
Flies, like a mistress, but to be pursued.<br />
O Congreve! boldly follow on the chase:<br />
She looks behind and wants thy strong embrace:<br />
She yields, she yields, surrenders all her charms,<br />
Do you but force her gently to your arms:<br />
Such nerves, such graces, in your lines appear,<br />
As you were made to be her ravisher.<br />
Dryden has long extended his command,<br />
By right divine, quite through the muses&rsquo; land,<br />
Absolute lord; and holding now from none,<br />
But great Apollo, his undoubted crown.<br />
That empire settled, and grown old in power<br />
Can wish for nothing but a successor:<br />
Not to enlarge his limits, but maintain<br />
Those provinces, which he alone could gain.<br />
His eldest Wycherly, in wise retreat,<br />
Thought it not worth his quiet to be great.<br />
Loose, wand&rsquo;ring Etherege, in wild pleasures tost,<br />
And foreign int&rsquo;rests, to his hopes long lost:<br />
Poor Lee and Otway dead!&nbsp; Congreve appears,<br />
The darling, and last comfort of his years.<br />
May&rsquo;st thou live long in thy great master&rsquo;s
smiles,<br />
And growing under him, adorn these isles.<br />
But when&mdash;when part of him (be that but late)<br />
His body yielding must submit to fate,<br />
Leaving his deathless works and thee behind<br />
(The natural successor of his mind),<br />
Then may&rsquo;st thou finish what he has begun:<br />
Heir to his merit, be in fame his son.<br />
What thou hast done, shews all is in thy pow&rsquo;r,<br />
And to write better, only must write more.<br />
&rsquo;Tis something to be willing to commend;<br />
But my best praise is, that I am your friend,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">THO. SOUTHERNE.</p>
<h3>TO MR. CONGREVE.</h3>
<p>The danger&rsquo;s great in these censorious days,<br />
When critics are so rife to venture praise:<br />
When the infectious and ill-natured brood<br />
Behold, and damn the work, because &rsquo;tis good,<br />
And with a proud, ungenerous spirit, try<br />
To pass an ostracism on poetry.<br />
But you, my friend, your worth does safely bear<br />
Above their spleen; you have no cause for fear;<br />
Like a well-mettled hawk, you took your flight<br />
Quite out of reach, and almost out of sight.<br />
As the strong sun, in a fair summer&rsquo;s day,<br />
You rise, and drive the mists and clouds away,<br />
The owls and bats, and all the birds of prey.<br />
Each line of yours, like polished steel&rsquo;s so hard,<br />
In beauty safe, it wants no other guard.<br />
Nature herself&rsquo;s beholden to your dress,<br />
Which though still like, much fairer you express.<br />
Some vainly striving honour to obtain,<br />
Leave to their heirs the traffic of their brain:<br />
Like China under ground, the ripening ware,<br />
In a long time, perhaps grows worth our care.<br />
But you now reap the fame, so well you&rsquo;ve sown;<br />
The planter tastes his fruit to ripeness grown.<br />
As a fair orange-tree at once is seen<br />
Big with what&rsquo;s ripe, yet springing still with green,<br />
So at one time, my worthy friend appears,<br />
With all the sap of youth, and weight of years.<br />
Accept my pious love, as forward zeal,<br />
Which though it ruins me I can&rsquo;t conceal:<br />
Exposed to censure for my weak applause,<br />
I&rsquo;m pleased to suffer in so just a cause;<br />
And though my offering may unworthy prove,<br />
Take, as a friend, the wishes of my love.</p>

<h3>TO MR. CONGREVE, ON HIS PLAY CALLED<br />
THE OLD BACHELOR.</h3>
<p>Wit, like true gold, refined from all allay,<br />
Immortal is, and never can decay:<br />
&rsquo;Tis in all times and languages the same,<br />
Nor can an ill translation quench the flame:<br />
For, though the form and fashion don&rsquo;t remain,<br />
The intrinsic value still it will retain.<br />
Then let each studied scene be writ with art,<br />
And judgment sweat to form the laboured part.<br />
Each character be just, and nature seem:<br />
Without th&rsquo; ingredient, wit, &rsquo;tis all but phlegm:<br
/>
For that&rsquo;s the soul, which all the mass must move,<br />
And wake our passions into grief or love.<br />
But you, too bounteous, sow your wit so thick,<br />
We are surprised, and know not where to pick;<br />
And while with clapping we are just to you,<br />
Ourselves we injure, and lose something new.<br />
What mayn&rsquo;t we then, great youth, of thee presage,<br />
Whose art and wit so much transcend thy age?<br />
How wilt thou shine at thy meridian height,<br />
Who, at thy rising, giv&rsquo;st so vast a light?<br />
When Dryden dying shall the world deceive,<br />
Whom we immortal, as his works, believe,<br />
Thou shalt succeed, the glory of the stage,<br />
Adorn and entertain the coming age.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">BEVIL. HIGGONS.</p>
<h3>PROLOGUE INTENDED FOR THE OLD BACHELOR.<br />
Written by the <span class="smcap">Lord Falkland</span>.</h3>
<p>Most authors on the stage at first appear<br />
Like widows&rsquo; bridegrooms, full of doubt and fear:<br />
They judge, from the experience of the dame,<br />
How hard a task it is to quench her flame;<br />
And who falls short of furnishing a course<br />
Up to his brawny predecessor&rsquo;s force,<br />
With utmost rage from her embraces thrown,<br />
Remains convicted as an empty drone.<br />
Thus often, to his shame, a pert beginner<br />
Proves in the end a miserable sinner.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As for our youngster, I am apt to doubt him,<br />
With all the vigour of his youth about him;<br />
But he, more sanguine, trusts in one and twenty,<br />
And impudently hopes he shall content you:<br />
For though his bachelor be worn and cold,<br />
He thinks the young may club to help the old,<br />
And what alone can be achieved by neither,<br />
Is often brought about by both together.<br />
The briskest of you all have felt alarms,<br />
Finding the fair one prostitute her charms<br />
With broken sighs, in her old fumbler&rsquo;s arms:<br />
But for our spark, he swears he&rsquo;ll ne&rsquo;er be
jealous<br />
Of any rivals, but young lusty fellows.<br />
Faith, let him try his chance, and if the slave,<br />
After his bragging, prove a washy knave,<br />
May he be banished to some lonely den<br />
And never more have leave to dip his pen.<br />
But if he be the champion he pretends,<br />
Both sexes sure will join to be his friends,<br />
For all agree, where all can have their ends.<br />
And you must own him for a man of might,<br />
If he holds out to please you the third night.</p>
<h3>PROLOGUE.<br />
Spoken by <span class="smcap">Mrs. Bracegirdle</span>.</h3>
<p>How this vile world is changed!&nbsp; In former days<br />
Prologues were serious speeches before plays,<br />
Grave, solemn things, as graces are to feasts,<br />
Where poets begged a blessing from their guests.<br />
But now no more like suppliants we come;<br />
A play makes war, and prologue is the drum.<br />
Armed with keen satire and with pointed wit,<br />
We threaten you who do for judges sit,<br />
To save our plays, or else we&rsquo;ll damn your pit.<br />
But for your comfort, it falls out to-day,<br />
We&rsquo;ve a young author and his first-born play;<br />
So, standing only on his good behaviour,<br />
He&rsquo;s very civil, and entreats your favour.<br />
Not but the man has malice, would he show it,<br />
But on my conscience he&rsquo;s a bashful poet;<br />
You think that strange&mdash;no matter, he&rsquo;ll outgrow
it.<br />
Well, I&rsquo;m his advocate: by me he prays you<br />
(I don&rsquo;t know whether I shall speak to please you),<br />
He prays&mdash;O bless me! what shall I do now?<br />
Hang me if I know what he prays, or how!<br />
And &rsquo;twas the prettiest prologue as he wrote it!<br />
Well, the deuce take me, if I han&rsquo;t forgot it.<br />
O Lord, for heav&rsquo;n&rsquo;s sake excuse the play,<br />
Because, you know, if it be damned to-day,<br />
I shall be hanged for wanting what to say.<br />
For my sake then&mdash;but I&rsquo;m in such confusion,<br />
I cannot stay to hear your resolution.</p>

<h3>ACT I.</h3>
<h4>SCENE I.</h4>
<p>SCENE: <i>The Street</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Bellmour</span> <i>and</i> <span
class="smcap">Vainlove</span> <i>meeting</i>.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; Vainlove, and abroad so early!&nbsp; Good-morrow;
I thought a contemplative lover could no more have parted with
his bed in a morning than he could have slept in&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>VAIN.&nbsp; Bellmour, good-morrow.&nbsp; Why, truth on&rsquo;t
is, these early sallies are not usual to me; but business, as you
see, sir&mdash;[<i>Showing Letters</i>.]&nbsp; And business must
be followed, or be lost.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; Business!&nbsp; And so must time, my friend, be
close pursued, or lost.&nbsp; Business is the rub of life,
perverts our aim, casts off the bias, and leaves us wide and
short of the intended mark.</p>
<p>VAIN.&nbsp; Pleasure, I guess you mean.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; Ay; what else has meaning?</p>
<p>VAIN.&nbsp; Oh, the wise will tell you&mdash;</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; More than they believe&mdash;or understand.</p>
<p>VAIN.&nbsp; How, how, Ned!&nbsp; A wise man say more than he
understands?</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; Ay, ay!&nbsp; Wisdom&rsquo;s nothing but a
pretending to know and believe more than we really do.&nbsp; You
read of but one wise man, and all that he knew was, that he knew
nothing.&nbsp; Come, come, leave business to idlers and wisdom to
fools; they have need of &rsquo;em.&nbsp; Wit be my faculty, and
pleasure my occupation; and let Father Time shake his
glass.&nbsp; Let low and earthly souls grovel till they have
worked themselves six foot deep into a grave.&nbsp; Business is
not my element&mdash;I roll in a higher orb, and dwell&mdash;</p>
<p>VAIN.&nbsp; In castles i&rsquo; th&rsquo; air of thy own
building.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s thy element, Ned.&nbsp; Well, as
high a flier as you are, I have a lure may make you stoop.&nbsp;
[<i>Flings a Letter</i>.]</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; I, marry, sir, I have a hawk&rsquo;s eye at a
woman&rsquo;s hand.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s more elegancy in the
false spelling of this superscription [<i>takes up the
Letter</i>] than in all Cicero.&nbsp; Let me see.&mdash;How
now!&mdash;Dear <i>perfidious Vainlove</i>.&nbsp;
[<i>Reads</i>.]</p>
<p>VAIN.&nbsp; Hold, hold, &rsquo;slife, that&rsquo;s the
wrong.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; Nay, let&rsquo;s see the
name&mdash;Sylvia!&mdash;how canst thou be ungrateful to that
creature?&nbsp; She&rsquo;s extremely pretty, and loves thee
entirely&mdash;I have heard her breathe such raptures about
thee&mdash;</p>
<p>VAIN.&nbsp; Ay, or anybody that she&rsquo;s about&mdash;</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; No, faith, Frank, you wrong her; she has been just
to you.</p>
<p>VAIN.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s pleasant, by my troth, from thee, who
hast had her.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; Never&mdash;her affections.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis true,
by heaven: she owned it to my face; and, blushing like the virgin
morn when it disclosed the cheat which that trusty bawd of
nature, night, had hid, confessed her soul was true to you;
though I by treachery had stolen the bliss.</p>
<p>VAIN.&nbsp; So was true as turtle&mdash;in
imagination&mdash;Ned, ha?&nbsp; Preach this doctrine to
husbands, and the married women will adore thee.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; Why, faith, I think it will do well enough, if the
husband be out of the way, for the wife to show her fondness and
impatience of his absence by choosing a lover as like him as she
can; and what is unlike, she may help out with her own fancy.</p>
<p>VAIN.&nbsp; But is it not an abuse to the lover to be made a
blind of?</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; As you say, the abuse is to the lover, not the
husband.&nbsp; For &rsquo;tis an argument of her great zeal
towards him, that she will enjoy him in effigy.</p>
<p>VAIN.&nbsp; It must be a very superstitious country where such
zeal passes for true devotion.&nbsp; I doubt it will be damned by
all our Protestant husbands for flat idolatry.&nbsp; But, if you
can make Alderman Fondlewife of your persuasion, this letter will
be needless.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; What!&nbsp; The old banker with the handsome
wife?</p>
<p>VAIN.&nbsp; Ay.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; Let me see&mdash;<i>L&aelig;titia</i>!&nbsp; Oh,
&rsquo;tis a delicious morsel.&nbsp; Dear Frank, thou art the
truest friend in the world.</p>
<p>VAIN.&nbsp; Ay, am I not?&nbsp; To be continually starting of
hares for you to course.&nbsp; We were certainly cut out for one
another; for my temper quits an amour just where thine takes it
up.&nbsp; But read that; it is an appointment for me, this
evening&mdash;when Fondlewife will be gone out of town, to meet
the master of a ship, about the return of a venture which
he&rsquo;s in danger of losing.&nbsp; Read, read.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; [<i>reads</i>.]&nbsp; Hum, Hum&mdash;Out of town
this evening, and talks of sending for Mr. Spintext to keep me
company; but I&rsquo;ll take care he shall not be at home.&nbsp;
Good!&nbsp; Spintext!&nbsp; Oh, the fanatic one-eyed parson!</p>
<p>VAIN.&nbsp; Ay.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; [<i>reads</i>.]&nbsp; Hum, Hum&mdash;That your
conversation will be much more agreeable, if you can counterfeit
his habit to blind the servants.&nbsp; Very good!&nbsp; Then I
must be disguised?&mdash;With all my heart!&mdash;It adds a gusto
to an amour; gives it the greater resemblance of theft; and,
among us lewd mortals, the deeper the sin the sweeter.&nbsp;
Frank, I&rsquo;m amazed at thy good nature&mdash;</p>
<p>VAIN.&nbsp; Faith, I hate love when &rsquo;tis forced upon a
man, as I do wine.&nbsp; And this business is none of my seeking;
I only happened to be, once or twice, where L&aelig;titia was the
handsomest woman in company; so, consequently, applied myself to
her&mdash;and it seems she has taken me at my word.&nbsp; Had you
been there, or anybody, &rsquo;t had been the same.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; I wish I may succeed as the same.</p>
<p>VAIN.&nbsp; Never doubt it; for if the spirit of cuckoldom be
once raised up in a woman, the devil can&rsquo;t lay it, until
she has done&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; Prithee, what sort of fellow is Fondlewife?</p>
<p>VAIN.&nbsp; A kind of mongrel zealot, sometimes very precise
and peevish.&nbsp; But I have seen him pleasant enough in his
way; much addicted to jealousy, but more to fondness; so that as
he is often jealous without a cause, he&rsquo;s as often
satisfied without reason.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; A very even temper, and fit for my purpose.&nbsp;
I must get your man Setter to provide my disguise.</p>
<p>VAIN.&nbsp; Ay; you may take him for good and all, if you
will, for you have made him fit for nobody else.&nbsp;
Well&mdash;</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re going to visit in return of
Sylvia&rsquo;s letter.&nbsp; Poor rogue!&nbsp; Any hour of the
day or night will serve her.&nbsp; But do you know nothing of a
new rival there?</p>
<p>VAIN.&nbsp; Yes; Heartwell&mdash;that surly, old, pretended
woman-hater&mdash;thinks her virtuous; that&rsquo;s one reason
why I fail her.&nbsp; I would have her fret herself out of
conceit with me, that she may entertain some thoughts of
him.&nbsp; I know he visits her every day.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; Yet rails on still, and thinks his love unknown to
us.&nbsp; A little time will swell him so, he must be forced to
give it birth; and the discovery must needs be very pleasant from
himself, to see what pains he will take, and how he will strain
to be delivered of a secret, when he has miscarried of it
already.</p>
<p>VAIN.&nbsp; Well, good-morrow.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s dine
together; I&rsquo;ll meet at the old place.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; With all my heart.&nbsp; It lies convenient for us
to pay our afternoon services to our mistresses.&nbsp; I find I
am damnably in love, I&rsquo;m so uneasy for not having seen
Belinda yesterday.</p>
<p>VAIN.&nbsp; But I saw my Araminta, yet am as impatient.</p>
<h4>SCENE II.</h4>
<p><span class="smcap">Bellmour</span> <i>alone</i>.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; Why, what a cormorant in love am I!&nbsp; Who, not
contented with the slavery of honourable love in one place, and
the pleasure of enjoying some half a score mistresses of my own
acquiring, must yet take Vainlove&rsquo;s business upon my hands,
because it lay too heavy upon his; so am not only forced to lie
with other men&rsquo;s wives for &rsquo;em, but must also
undertake the harder task of obliging their mistresses.&nbsp; I
must take up, or I shall never hold out.&nbsp; Flesh and blood
cannot bear it always.</p>
<h4>SCENE III.</h4>
<p>[<i>To him</i>] <span class="smcap">Sharper</span>.</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sorry to see this, Ned.&nbsp; Once a
man comes to his soliloquies, I give him for gone.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; Sharper, I&rsquo;m glad to see thee.</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; What! is Belinda cruel, that you are so
thoughtful?</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; No, faith, not for that.&nbsp; But there&rsquo;s a
business of consequence fallen out to-day that requires some
consideration.</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; Prithee, what mighty business of consequence
canst thou have?</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; Why, you must know, &rsquo;tis a piece of work
toward the finishing of an alderman.&nbsp; It seems I must put
the last hand to it, and dub him cuckold, that he may be of equal
dignity with the rest of his brethren: so I must beg
Belinda&rsquo;s pardon.</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; Faith, e&rsquo;en give her over for good and all;
you can have no hopes of getting her for a mistress; and she is
too proud, too inconstant, too affected and too witty, and too
handsome for a wife.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; But she can&rsquo;t have too much money.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s twelve thousand pound, Tom.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis true
she is excessively foppish and affected; but in my conscience I
believe the baggage loves me: for she never speaks well of me
herself, nor suffers anybody else to rail at me.&nbsp; Then, as I
told you, there&rsquo;s twelve thousand pound.&nbsp; Hum!&nbsp;
Why, faith, upon second thoughts, she does not appear to be so
very affected neither.&mdash;Give her her due, I think the
woman&rsquo;s a woman, and that&rsquo;s all.&nbsp; As such,
I&rsquo;m sure I shall like her; for the devil take me if I
don&rsquo;t love all the sex.</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; And here comes one who swears as heartily he
hates all the sex.</p>
<h4>SCENE IV.</h4>
<p>[<i>To them</i>] <span class="smcap">Heartwell</span>.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; Who?&nbsp; Heartwell?&nbsp; Ay, but he knows
better things.&nbsp; How now, George, where hast thou been
snarling odious truths, and entertaining company, like a
physician, with discourse of their diseases and
infirmities?&nbsp; What fine lady hast thou been putting out of
conceit with herself, and persuading that the face she had been
making all the morning was none of her own?&nbsp; For I know thou
art as unmannerly and as unwelcome to a woman as a looking-glass
after the smallpox.</p>
<p>HEART.&nbsp; I confess I have not been sneering fulsome lies
and nauseous flattery; fawning upon a little tawdry whore, that
will fawn upon me again, and entertain any puppy that comes, like
a tumbler, with the same tricks over and over.&nbsp; For such, I
guess, may have been your late employment.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; Would thou hadst come a little sooner.&nbsp;
Vainlove would have wrought thy conversion, and been a champion
for the cause.</p>
<p>HEART.&nbsp; What! has he been here?&nbsp; That&rsquo;s one of
love&rsquo;s April fools; is always upon some errand that&rsquo;s
to no purpose; ever embarking in adventures, yet never comes to
harbour.</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s because he always sets out in foul
weather, loves to buffet with the winds, meet the tide, and sail
in the teeth of opposition.</p>
<p>HEART.&nbsp; What!&nbsp; Has he not dropt anchor at
Araminta?</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; Truth on&rsquo;t is she fits his temper best, is a
kind of floating island; sometimes seems in reach, then vanishes
and keeps him busied in the search.</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; She had need have a good share of sense to manage
so capricious a lover.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; Faith I don&rsquo;t know, he&rsquo;s of a temper
the most easy to himself in the world; he takes as much always of
an amour as he cares for, and quits it when it grows stale or
unpleasant.</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; An argument of very little passion, very good
understanding, and very ill nature.</p>
<p>HEART.&nbsp; And proves that Vainlove plays the fool with
discretion.</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; You, Bellmour, are bound in gratitude to stickle
for him; you with pleasure reap that fruit, which he takes pains
to sow: he does the drudgery in the mine, and you stamp your
image on the gold.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s of another opinion, and says I do the
drudgery in the mine.&nbsp; Well, we have each our share of
sport, and each that which he likes best; &rsquo;tis his
diversion to set, &rsquo;tis mine to cover the partridge.</p>
<p>HEART.&nbsp; And it should be mine to let &rsquo;em go
again.</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; Not till you had mouthed a little, George.&nbsp;
I think that&rsquo;s all thou art fit for now.</p>
<p>HEART.&nbsp; Good Mr. Young-Fellow, you&rsquo;re mistaken; as
able as yourself, and as nimble, too, though I mayn&rsquo;t have
so much mercury in my limbs; &rsquo;tis true, indeed, I
don&rsquo;t force appetite, but wait the natural call of my lust,
and think it time enough to be lewd after I have had the
temptation.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; Time enough, ay, too soon, I should rather have
expected, from a person of your gravity.</p>
<p>HEART.&nbsp; Yet it is oftentimes too late with some of you
young, termagant, flashy sinners&mdash;you have all the guilt of
the intention, and none of the pleasure of the
practice&mdash;&rsquo;tis true you are so eager in pursuit of the
temptation, that you save the devil the trouble of leading you
into it.&nbsp; Nor is it out of discretion that you don&rsquo;t
swallow that very hook yourselves have baited, but you are cloyed
with the preparative, and what you mean for a whet, turns the
edge of your puny stomachs.&nbsp; Your love is like your courage,
which you show for the first year or two upon all occasions; till
in a little time, being disabled or disarmed, you abate of your
vigour; and that daring blade which was so often drawn, is bound
to the peace for ever after.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; Thou art an old fornicator of a singular good
principle indeed, and art for encouraging youth, that they may be
as wicked as thou art at thy years.</p>
<p>HEART.&nbsp; I am for having everybody be what they pretend to
be: a whoremaster be a whoremaster, and not like Vainlove, kiss a
lap-dog with passion, when it would disgust him from the
lady&rsquo;s own lips.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; That only happens sometimes, where the dog has the
sweeter breath, for the more cleanly conveyance.&nbsp; But,
George, you must not quarrel with little gallantries of this
nature: women are often won by &rsquo;em.&nbsp; Who would refuse
to kiss a lap-dog, if it were preliminary to the lips of his
lady?</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; Or omit playing with her fan, and cooling her if
she were hot, when it might entitle him to the office of warming
her when she should be cold?</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; What is it to read a play in a rainy day?&nbsp;
Though you should be now and then interrupted in a witty scene,
and she perhaps preserve her laughter, till the jest were over;
even that may be borne with, considering the reward in
prospect.</p>
<p>HEART.&nbsp; I confess you that are women&rsquo;s asses bear
greater burdens: are forced to undergo dressing, dancing,
singing, sighing, whining, rhyming, flattering, lying, grinning,
cringing, and the drudgery of loving to boot.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; O brute, the drudgery of loving!</p>
<p>HEART.&nbsp; Ay!&nbsp; Why, to come to love through all these
incumbrances is like coming to an estate overcharged with debts,
which, by the time you have paid, yields no further profit than
what the bare tillage and manuring of the land will produce at
the expense of your own sweat.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; Prithee, how dost thou love?</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; He!&nbsp; He hates the sex.</p>
<p>HEART.&nbsp; So I hate physic too&mdash;yet I may love to take
it for my health.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; Well come off, George, if at any time you should
be taken straying.</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; He has need of such an excuse, considering the
present state of his body.</p>
<p>HEART.&nbsp; How d&rsquo;ye mean?</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; Why, if whoring be purging, as you call it, then,
I may say, marriage is entering into a course of physic.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; How, George!&nbsp; Does the wind blow there?</p>
<p>HEART.&nbsp; It will as soon blow north and by
south&mdash;marry, quotha!&nbsp; I hope in heaven I have a
greater portion of grace, and I think I have baited too many of
those traps to be caught in one myself.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; Who the devil would have thee? unless &rsquo;twere
an oysterwoman to propagate young fry for Billingsgate&mdash;thy
talent will never recommend thee to anything of better
quality.</p>
<p>HEART.&nbsp; My talent is chiefly that of speaking truth,
which I don&rsquo;t expect should ever recommend me to people of
quality.&nbsp; I thank heaven I have very honestly purchased the
hatred of all the great families in town.</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; And you in return of spleen hate them.&nbsp; But
could you hope to be received into the alliance of a noble
family&mdash;</p>
<p>HEART.&nbsp; No; I hope I shall never merit that affliction,
to be punished with a wife of birth, be a stag of the first head
and bear my horns aloft, like one of the supporters of my
wife&rsquo;s coat.&nbsp; S&rsquo;death I would not be a Cuckold
to e&rsquo;er an illustrious whore in England.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; What, not to make your family, man and provide for
your children?</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; For her children, you mean.</p>
<p>HEART.&nbsp; Ay, there you&rsquo;ve nicked it.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s the devil upon devil.&nbsp; Oh, the pride and joy
of heart &rsquo;twould be to me to have my son and heir resemble
such a duke; to have a fleering coxcomb scoff and cry, &lsquo;Mr.
your son&rsquo;s mighty like his Grace, has just his smile and
air of&rsquo;s face.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then replies another,
&lsquo;Methinks he has more of the Marquess of such a place about
his nose and eyes, though he has my Lord
what-d&rsquo;ye-call&rsquo;s mouth to a tittle.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then
I, to put it off as unconcerned, come chuck the infant under the
chin, force a smile, and cry, &lsquo;Ay, the boy takes after his
mother&rsquo;s relations,&rsquo; when the devil and she knows
&rsquo;tis a little compound of the whole body of nobility.</p>
<p>BELL+SHARP.&nbsp; Ha, ha, ha!</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; Well, but, George, I have one question to ask
you&mdash;</p>
<p>HEART.&nbsp; Pshaw, I have prattled away my time.&nbsp; I hope
you are in no haste for an answer, for I shan&rsquo;t stay
now.&nbsp; [<i>Looking on his watch</i>.]</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; Nay, prithee, George&mdash;</p>
<p>HEART.&nbsp; No; besides my business, I see a fool coming this
way.&nbsp; Adieu.</p>
<h4>SCENE V.</h4>
<p><span class="smcap">Sharper</span>, <span
class="smcap">Bellmour</span>.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; What does he mean?&nbsp; Oh, &rsquo;tis Sir Joseph
Wittoll with his friend; but I see he has turned the corner and
goes another way.</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; What in the name of wonder is it?</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; Why, a fool.</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis a tawdry outside.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; And a very beggarly lining&mdash;yet he may be
worth your acquaintance; a little of thy chymistry, Tom, may
extract gold from that dirt.</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; Say you so?&nbsp; &rsquo;Faith I am as poor as a
chymist, and would be as industrious.&nbsp; But what was he that
followed him?&nbsp; Is not he a dragon that watches those golden
pippins?</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; Hang him, no, he a dragon!&nbsp; If he be,
&rsquo;tis a very peaceful one.&nbsp; I can ensure his anger
dormant; or should he seem to rouse, &rsquo;tis but well lashing
him, and he will sleep like a top.</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; Ay, is he of that kidney?</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; Yet is adored by that bigot, Sir Joseph Wittoll,
as the image of valour.&nbsp; He calls him his back, and indeed
they are never asunder&mdash;yet, last night, I know not by what
mischance, the knight was alone, and had fallen into the hands of
some night-walkers, who, I suppose, would have pillaged
him.&nbsp; But I chanced to come by and rescued him, though I
believe he was heartily frightened; for as soon as ever he was
loose, he ran away without staying to see who had helped him.</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; Is that bully of his in the army?</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; No; but is a pretender, and wears the habit of a
soldier, which nowadays as often cloaks cowardice, as a black
gown does atheism.&nbsp; You must know he has been
abroad&mdash;went purely to run away from a campaign; enriched
himself with the plunder of a few oaths, and here vents them
against the general, who, slighting men of merit, and preferring
only those of interest, has made him quit the service.</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; Wherein no doubt he magnifies his own
performance.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; Speaks miracles, is the drum to his own
praise&mdash;the only implement of a soldier he resembles, like
that, being full of blustering noise and emptiness&mdash;</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; And like that, of no use but to be beaten.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; Right; but then the comparison breaks, for he will
take a drubbing with as little noise as a pulpit cushion.</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; His name, and I have done?</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; Why, that, to pass it current too, he has gilded
with a title: he is called Capt. Bluffe.</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; Well, I&rsquo;ll endeavour his
acquaintance&mdash;you steer another course, are bound&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>For love&rsquo;s island: I, for the golden
coast.<br />
May each succeed in what he wishes most.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>ACT II.</h3>
<h4>SCENE I.</h4>
<p><span class="smcap">Sir Joseph Wittoll</span>, <span
class="smcap">Sharper</span> <i>following</i>.</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; Sure that&rsquo;s he, and alone.</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; Um&mdash;Ay, this, this is the very damned
place; the inhuman cannibals, the bloody-minded villains, would
have butchered me last night.&nbsp; No doubt they would have
flayed me alive, have sold my skin, and devoured, etc.</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; How&rsquo;s this!</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; An it hadn&rsquo;t been for a civil gentleman as
came by and frighted &rsquo;em away&mdash;but, agad, I durst not
stay to give him thanks.</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; This must be Bellmour he means.&nbsp; Ha!&nbsp; I
have a thought&mdash;</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; Zooks, would the captain would come; the very
remembrance makes me quake; agad, I shall never be reconciled to
this place heartily.</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis but trying, and being where I am at
worst, now luck!&mdash;cursed fortune! this must be the place,
this damned unlucky place&mdash;</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; Agad, and so &rsquo;tis.&nbsp; Why, here has
been more mischief done, I perceive.</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; No, &rsquo;tis gone, &rsquo;tis lost&mdash;ten
thousand devils on that chance which drew me hither; ay, here,
just here, this spot to me is hell; nothing to be found, but the
despair of what I&rsquo;ve lost.&nbsp; [<i>Looking about as in
search</i>.]</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; Poor gentleman!&nbsp; By the Lord Harry
I&rsquo;ll stay no longer, for I have found too&mdash;</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; Ha! who&rsquo;s that has found?&nbsp; What have
you found?&nbsp; Restore it quickly, or by&mdash;</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; Not I, sir, not I; as I&rsquo;ve a soul to be
saved, I have found nothing but what has been to my loss, as I
may say, and as you were saying, sir.</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; Oh, your servant, sir; you are safe, then, it
seems.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis an ill wind that blows nobody good.&nbsp;
Well, you may rejoice over my ill fortune, since it paid the
price of your ransom.</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; I rejoice! agad, not I, sir: I&rsquo;m very
sorry for your loss, with all my heart, blood and guts, sir; and
if you did but know me, you&rsquo;d ne&rsquo;er say I were so
ill-natured.</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; Know you!&nbsp; Why, can you be so ungrateful to
forget me?</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; O Lord, forget him!&nbsp; No, no, sir, I
don&rsquo;t forget you&mdash;because I never saw your face
before, agad.&nbsp; Ha, ha, ha!</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; How!&nbsp; [<i>Angrily</i>.]</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; Stay, stay, sir, let me
recollect&mdash;he&rsquo;s a damned angry fellow&mdash;I believe
I had better remember him, until I can get out of his sight; but
out of sight out of mind, agad.&nbsp; [<i>Aside</i>.]</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; Methought the service I did you last night, sir,
in preserving you from those ruffians, might have taken better
root in your shallow memory.</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; Gads-daggers-belts-blades and scabbards, this is
the very gentleman!&nbsp; How shall I make him a return suitable
to the greatness of his merit?&nbsp; I had a pretty thing to that
purpose, if he ha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t frighted it out of my
memory.&nbsp; Hem! hem! sir, I most submissively implore your
pardon for my transgression of ingratitude and omission; having
my entire dependence, sir, upon the superfluity of your goodness,
which, like an inundation, will, I hope, totally immerge the
recollection of my error, and leave me floating, in your sight,
upon the full-blown bladders of repentance&mdash;by the help of
which, I shall once more hope to swim into your favour.&nbsp;
[<i>Bows</i>.]</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; So-h, oh, sir, I am easily pacified, the
acknowledgment of a gentleman&mdash;</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; Acknowledgment!&nbsp; Sir, I am all over
acknowledgment, and will not stick to show it in the greatest
extremity by night or by day, in sickness or in health, winter or
summer; all seasons and occasions shall testify the reality and
gratitude of your superabundant humble servant, Sir Joseph
Wittoll, knight.&nbsp; Hem! hem!</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; Sir Joseph Wittoll?</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; The same, sir, of Wittoll Hall in
<i>Comitatu</i> Bucks.</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; Is it possible!&nbsp; Then I am happy to have
obliged the mirror of knighthood and pink of courtesie in the
age.&nbsp; Let me embrace you.</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; O Lord, sir!</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; My loss I esteem as a trifle repaid with
interest, since it has purchased me the friendship and
acquaintance of the person in the world whose character I
admire.</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; You are only pleased to say so, sir.&nbsp; But,
pray, if I may be so bold, what is that loss you mention?</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; Oh, term it no longer so, sir.&nbsp; In the
scuffle last night I only dropt a bill of a hundred pound, which,
I confess, I came half despairing to recover; but, thanks to my
better fortune&mdash;</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; You have found it, sir, then, it seems; I
profess I&rsquo;m heartily glad&mdash;</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; Sir, your humble servant.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t
question but you are, that you have so cheap an opportunity of
expressing your gratitude and generosity, since the paying so
trivial a sum will wholly acquit you and doubly engage me.</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; What a dickens does he mean by a trivial
sum?&nbsp; [<i>Aside</i>.]&nbsp; But ha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t you found
it, sir!</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; No otherwise, I vow to Gad, but in my hopes in
you, sir.</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; Humh.</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; But that&rsquo;s sufficient.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twere
injustice to doubt the honour of Sir Joseph Wittoll.</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; O Lord, sir.</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; You are above, I&rsquo;m sure, a thought so low,
to suffer me to lose what was ventured in your service; nay,
&rsquo;twas in a manner paid down for your deliverance;
&rsquo;twas so much lent you.&nbsp; And you scorn, I&rsquo;ll say
that for you&mdash;</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; Nay, I&rsquo;ll say that for myself, with your
leave, sir, I do scorn a dirty thing.&nbsp; But, agad, I&rsquo;m
a little out of pocket at present.</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; Pshaw, you can&rsquo;t want a hundred
pound.&nbsp; Your word is sufficient anywhere.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis
but borrowing so much dirt.&nbsp; You have large acres, and can
soon repay it.&nbsp; Money is but dirt, Sir Joseph&mdash;mere
dirt.</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; But, I profess, &rsquo;tis a dirt I have washed
my hands of at present; I have laid it all out upon my Back.</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; Are you so extravagant in clothes, Sir
Joseph?</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; Ha, ha, ha, a very good jest, I profess, ha, ha,
ha, a very good jest, and I did not know that I had said it, and
that&rsquo;s a better jest than t&rsquo;other.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis a
sign you and I ha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t been long acquainted; you have
lost a good jest for want of knowing me&mdash;I only mean a
friend of mine whom I call my Back; he sticks as close to me, and
follows me through all dangers&mdash;he is indeed back, breast,
and head-piece, as it were, to me.&nbsp; Agad, he&rsquo;s a brave
fellow.&nbsp; Pauh, I am quite another thing when I am with him:
I don&rsquo;t fear the devil (bless us) almost if he be by.&nbsp;
Ah! had he been with me last night&mdash;</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; If he had, sir, what then? he could have done no
more, nor perhaps have suffered so much.&nbsp; Had he a hundred
pound to lose?&nbsp; [<i>Angrily</i>.]</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; O Lord, sir, by no means, but I might have saved
a hundred pound: I meant innocently, as I hope to be saved, sir
(a damned hot fellow), only, as I was saying, I let him have all
my ready money to redeem his great sword from limbo.&nbsp; But,
sir, I have a letter of credit to Alderman Fondlewife, as far as
two hundred pound, and this afternoon you shall see I am a
person, such a one as you would wish to have met with&mdash;</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; That you are, I&rsquo;ll be sworn.&nbsp;
[<i>Aside</i>.]&nbsp; Why, that&rsquo;s great and like
yourself.</p>
<h4>SCENE II.</h4>
<p>[<i>To them</i>] <span class="smcap">Captain
Bluffe</span>.</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; Oh, here a&rsquo; comes&mdash;Ay, my Hector of
Troy, welcome, my bully, my Back; agad, my heart has gone a pit
pat for thee.</p>
<p>BLUFF.&nbsp; How now, my young knight?&nbsp; Not for fear, I
hope; he that knows me must be a stranger to fear.</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; Nay, agad, I hate fear ever since I had like to
have died of a fright.&nbsp; But&mdash;</p>
<p>BLUFF.&nbsp; But?&nbsp; Look you here, boy, here&rsquo;s your
antidote, here&rsquo;s your Jesuits&rsquo; powder for a shaking
fit.&nbsp; But who hast thou got with thee? is he of
mettle?&nbsp; [<i>Laying his hand upon his sword</i>.]</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; Ay, bully, a devilish smart fellow: &rsquo;a
will fight like a cock.</p>
<p>BLUFF.&nbsp; Say you so?&nbsp; Then I honour him.&nbsp; But
has he been abroad? for every cock will fight upon his own
dunghill.</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know, but I&rsquo;ll present
you&mdash;</p>
<p>BLUFF.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll recommend myself.&nbsp; Sir, I honour
you; I understand you love fighting, I reverence a man that loves
fighting.&nbsp; Sir, I kiss your hilts.</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; Sir, your servant, but you are misinformed, for,
unless it be to serve my particular friend, as Sir Joseph here,
my country, or my religion, or in some very justifiable cause,
I&rsquo;m not for it.</p>
<p>BLUFF.&nbsp; O Lord, I beg your pardon, sir, I find you are
not of my palate: you can&rsquo;t relish a dish of fighting
without sweet sauce.&nbsp; Now, I think fighting for fighting
sake&rsquo;s sufficient cause; fighting to me&rsquo;s religion
and the laws.</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; Ah, well said, my Hero; was not that great, sir?
by the Lord Harry he says true; fighting is meat, drink, and
cloth to him.&nbsp; But, Back, this gentleman is one of the best
friends I have in the world, and saved my life last
night&mdash;you know I told you.</p>
<p>BLUFF.&nbsp; Ay!&nbsp; Then I honour him again.&nbsp; Sir, may
I crave your name?</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; Ay, sir, my name&rsquo;s Sharper.</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; Pray, Mr. Sharper, embrace my Back.&nbsp; Very
well.&nbsp; By the Lord Harry, Mr. Sharper, he&rsquo;s as brave a
fellow as Cannibal, are not you, Bully-Back?</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; Hannibal, I believe you mean, Sir Joseph.</p>
<p>BLUFF.&nbsp; Undoubtedly he did, sir; faith, Hannibal was a
very pretty fellow&mdash;but, Sir Joseph, comparisons are
odious&mdash;Hannibal was a very pretty fellow in those days, it
must be granted&mdash;but alas, sir! were he alive now, he would
be nothing, nothing in the earth.</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; How, sir!&nbsp; I make a doubt if there be at
this day a greater general breathing.</p>
<p>BLUFF.&nbsp; Oh, excuse me, sir!&nbsp; Have you served abroad,
sir?</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; Not I, really, sir.</p>
<p>BLUFF.&nbsp; Oh, I thought so.&nbsp; Why, then, you can know
nothing, sir: I am afraid you scarce know the history of the late
war in Flanders, with all its particulars.</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; Not I, sir, no more than public letters or
gazettes tell us.</p>
<p>BLUFF.&nbsp; Gazette!&nbsp; Why there again now.&nbsp; Why,
sir, there are not three words of truth the year round put into
the Gazette.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll tell you a strange thing now as to
that.&nbsp; You must know, sir, I was resident in Flanders the
last campaign, had a small post there, but no matter for
that.&nbsp; Perhaps, sir, there was scarce anything of moment
done but an humble servant of yours, that shall be nameless, was
an eye-witness of.&nbsp; I won&rsquo;t say had the greatest share
in&rsquo;t, though I might say that too, since I name nobody you
know.&nbsp; Well, Mr. Sharper, would you think it?&nbsp; In all
this time, as I hope for a truncheon, this rascally
gazette-writer never so much as once mentioned me&mdash;not once,
by the wars&mdash;took no more notice than as if Nol. Bluffe had
not been in the land of the living.</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; Strange!</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; Yet, by the Lord Harry, &rsquo;tis true, Mr.
Sharper, for I went every day to coffee-houses to read the
gazette myself.</p>
<p>BLUFF.&nbsp; Ay, ay, no matter.&nbsp; You see, Mr. Sharper,
after all I am content to retire; live a private person.&nbsp;
Scipio and others have done it.</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; Impudent rogue.&nbsp; [<i>Aside</i>.]</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; Ay, this damned modesty of yours.&nbsp; Agad, if
he would put in for&rsquo;t he might be made general himself
yet.</p>
<p>BLUFF.&nbsp; Oh, fie! no, Sir Joseph; you know I hate
this.</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; Let me but tell Mr. Sharper a little, how you
ate fire once out of the mouth of a cannon.&nbsp; Agad, he did;
those impenetrable whiskers of his have confronted
flames&mdash;</p>
<p>BLUFF.&nbsp; Death, what do you mean, Sir Joseph?</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; Look you now.&nbsp; I tell you he&rsquo;s so
modest he&rsquo;ll own nothing.</p>
<p>BLUFF.&nbsp; Pish, you have put me out, I have forgot what I
was about.&nbsp; Pray hold your tongue, and give me leave.&nbsp;
[<i>Angrily</i>.]</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; I am dumb.</p>
<p>BLUFF.&nbsp; This sword I think I was telling you of, Mr.
Sharper.&nbsp; This sword I&rsquo;ll maintain to be the best
divine, anatomist, lawyer, or casuist in Europe; it shall decide
a controversy or split a cause&mdash;</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; Nay, now I must speak; it will split a hair, by
the Lord Harry, I have seen it.</p>
<p>BLUFF.&nbsp; Zounds, sir, it&rsquo;s a lie; you have not seen
it, nor sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t see it; sir, I say you can&rsquo;t
see; what d&rsquo;ye say to that now?</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; I am blind.</p>
<p>BLUFF.&nbsp; Death, had any other man interrupted
me&mdash;</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; Good Mr. Sharper, speak to him; I dare not look
that way.</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; Captain, Sir Joseph&rsquo;s penitent.</p>
<p>BLUFF.&nbsp; Oh, I am calm, sir, calm as a discharged
culverin.&nbsp; But &rsquo;twas indiscreet, when you know what
will provoke me.&nbsp; Nay, come, Sir Joseph, you know my
heat&rsquo;s soon over.</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; Well, I am a fool sometimes, but I&rsquo;m
sorry.</p>
<p>BLUFF.&nbsp; Enough.</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; Come, we&rsquo;ll go take a glass to drown
animosities.&nbsp; Mr. Sharper, will you partake?</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; I wait on you, sir.&nbsp; Nay, pray, Captain; you
are Sir Joseph&rsquo;s back.</p>

<i>waiting</i>, <i>in Araminta&rsquo;s apartment</i>.</p>
<p>BELIN.&nbsp; Ah! nay, dear; prithee, good, dear, sweet cousin,
no more.&nbsp; O Gad!&nbsp; I swear you&rsquo;d make one sick to
hear you.</p>
<p>ARAM.&nbsp; Bless me! what have I said to move you thus?</p>
<p>BELIN.&nbsp; Oh, you have raved, talked idly, and all in
commendation of that filthy, awkward, two-legged creature
man.&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;ve said; your
fever has transported you.</p>
<p>ARAM.&nbsp; If love be the fever which you mean, kind heaven
avert the cure.&nbsp; Let me have oil to feed that flame, and
never let it be extinct till I myself am ashes.</p>
<p>BELIN.&nbsp; There was a whine!&nbsp; O Gad, I hate your
horrid fancy.&nbsp; This love is the devil, and, sure, to be in
love is to be possessed.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis in the head, the heart,
the blood, the&mdash;all over.&nbsp; O Gad, you are quite
spoiled.&nbsp; I shall loathe the sight of mankind for your
sake.</p>
<p>ARAM.&nbsp; Fie! this is gross affectation.&nbsp; A little of
Bellmour&rsquo;s company would change the scene.</p>
<p>BELIN.&nbsp; Filthy fellow!&nbsp; I wonder, cousin&mdash;</p>
<p>ARAM.&nbsp; I wonder, cousin, you should imagine I don&rsquo;t
perceive you love him.</p>
<p>BELIN.&nbsp; Oh, I love your hideous fancy!&nbsp; Ha, ha, ha,
love a man!</p>
<p>ARAM.&nbsp; Love a man! yes, you would not love a beast.</p>
<p>BELIN.&nbsp; Of all beasts not an ass&mdash;which is so like
your Vainlove.&nbsp; Lard, I have seen an ass look so chagrin,
ha, ha, ha (you must pardon me, I can&rsquo;t help laughing),
that an absolute lover would have concluded the poor creature to
have had darts, and flames, and altars, and all that in his
breast.&nbsp; Araminta, come, I&rsquo;ll talk seriously to you
now; could you but see with my eyes the buffoonery of one scene
of address, a lover, set out with all his equipage and
appurtenances; O Gad I sure you would&mdash;But you play the
game, and consequently can&rsquo;t see the miscarriages obvious
to every stander by.</p>
<p>ARAM.&nbsp; Yes, yes; I can see something near it when you and
Bellmour meet.&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t know that you dreamt of
Bellmour last night, and called him aloud in your sleep.</p>
<p>BELIN.&nbsp; Pish, I can&rsquo;t help dreaming of the devil
sometimes; would you from thence infer I love him?</p>
<p>ARAM.&nbsp; But that&rsquo;s not all; you caught me in your
arms when you named him, and pressed me to your bosom.&nbsp;
Sure, if I had not pinched you until you waked, you had stifled
me with kisses.</p>
<p>BELIN.&nbsp; O barbarous aspersion!</p>
<p>ARAM.&nbsp; No aspersion, cousin, we are alone.&nbsp; Nay, I
can tell you more.</p>
<p>BELIN.&nbsp; I deny it all.</p>
<p>ARAM.&nbsp; What, before you hear it?</p>
<p>BELIN.&nbsp; My denial is premeditated like your malice.&nbsp;
Lard, cousin, you talk oddly.&nbsp; Whatever the matter is, O my
Sol, I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;ll follow evil courses.</p>
<p>ARAM.&nbsp; Ha, ha, ha, this is pleasant.</p>
<p>BELIN.&nbsp; You may laugh, but&mdash;</p>
<p>ARAM.&nbsp; Ha, ha, ha!</p>
<p>BELIN.&nbsp; You think the malicious grin becomes you.&nbsp;
The devil take Bellmour.&nbsp; Why do you tell me of him?</p>
<p>ARAM.&nbsp; Oh, is it come out?&nbsp; Now you are angry, I am
sure you love him.&nbsp; I tell nobody else, cousin.&nbsp; I have
not betrayed you yet.</p>
<p>BELIN.&nbsp; Prithee tell it all the world; it&rsquo;s
false.</p>
<p>ARAM.&nbsp; Come, then, kiss and friends.</p>
<p>BELIN.&nbsp; Pish.</p>
<p>ARAM.&nbsp; Prithee don&rsquo;t be so peevish.</p>
<p>BELIN.&nbsp; Prithee don&rsquo;t be so impertinent.&nbsp;
Betty!</p>
<p>ARAM.&nbsp; Ha, ha, ha!</p>
<p>BETTY.&nbsp; Did your ladyship call, madam?</p>
<p>BELIN.&nbsp; Get my hoods and tippet, and bid the footman call
a chair.</p>
<p>ARAM.&nbsp; I hope you are not going out in dudgeon,
cousin.</p>
<h4>SCENE IV.</h4>
<p>[<i>To them</i>] <span class="smcap">Footman</span>.</p>
<p>FOOT.&nbsp; Madam, there are&mdash;</p>
<p>BELIN.&nbsp; Is there a chair?</p>
<p>FOOT.&nbsp; No, madam, there are Mr. Bellmour and Mr. Vainlove
to wait upon your ladyship.</p>
<p>ARAM.&nbsp; Are they below?</p>
<p>FOOT.&nbsp; No, madam, they sent before, to know if you were
at home.</p>
<p>BELIN.&nbsp; The visit&rsquo;s to you, cousin; I suppose I am
at my liberty.</p>
<p>ARAM.&nbsp; Be ready to show &rsquo;em up.</p>
<h4>SCENE V.</h4>
<p>[<i>To them</i>] <span class="smcap">Betty</span>, <i>with
Hoods and Looking-glass</i>.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t tell, cousin; I believe we are equally
concerned.&nbsp; But if you continue your humour, it won&rsquo;t
be very entertaining.&nbsp; (I know she&rsquo;d fain be persuaded
to stay.)&nbsp; [<i>Aside</i>.]</p>
<p>BELIN.&nbsp; I shall oblige you, in leaving you to the full
and free enjoyment of that conversation you admire.</p>
<p>BELIN.&nbsp; Let me see; hold the glass.&nbsp; Lard, I look
wretchedly to-day!</p>
<p>ARAM.&nbsp; Betty, why don&rsquo;t you help my cousin?&nbsp;
[<i>Putting on her hoods</i>.]</p>
<p>BELIN.&nbsp; Hold off your fists, and see that he gets a chair
with a high roof, or a very low seat.&nbsp; Stay, come back here,
you Mrs. Fidget&mdash;you are so ready to go to the
footman.&nbsp; Here, take &rsquo;em all again, my mind&rsquo;s
changed; I won&rsquo;t go.</p>
<h4>SCENE VI.</h4>
<p><span class="smcap">Araminta</span>, <span
class="smcap">Belinda</span>.</p>
<p>ARAM.&nbsp; So, this I expected.&nbsp; You won&rsquo;t oblige
me, then, cousin, and let me have all the company to myself?</p>
<p>BELIN.&nbsp; No; upon deliberation, I have too much charity to
trust you to yourself.&nbsp; The devil watches all opportunities;
and in this favourable disposition of your mind, heaven knows how
far you may be tempted: I am tender of your reputation.</p>
<p>ARAM.&nbsp; I am obliged to you.&nbsp; But who&rsquo;s
malicious now, Belinda?</p>
<p>BELIN.&nbsp; Not I; witness my heart, I stay out of pure
affection.</p>
<p>ARAM.&nbsp; In my conscience I believe you.</p>
<h4>SCENE VII.</h4>
<p>[<i>To them</i>] <span class="smcap">Vainlove</span>, <span
class="smcap">Bellmour</span>, <span
class="smcap">Footman</span>.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; So, fortune be praised!&nbsp; To find you both
within, ladies, is&mdash;</p>
<p>ARAM.&nbsp; No miracle, I hope.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; Not o&rsquo; your side, madam, I confess.&nbsp;
But my tyrant there and I, are two buckets that can never come
together.</p>
<p>BELIN.&nbsp; Nor are ever like.&nbsp; Yet we often meet and
clash.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; How never like! marry, Hymen forbid.&nbsp; But
this it is to run so extravagantly in debt; I have laid out such
a world of love in your service, that you think you can never be
able to pay me all.&nbsp; So shun me for the same reason that you
would a dun.</p>
<p>BELIN.&nbsp; Ay, on my conscience, and the most impertinent
and troublesome of duns&mdash;a dun for money will be quiet, when
he sees his debtor has not wherewithal.&nbsp; But a dun for love
is an eternal torment that never rests&mdash;</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; Until he has created love where there was none,
and then gets it for his pains.&nbsp; For importunity in love,
like importunity at Court, first creates its own interest and
then pursues it for the favour.</p>
<p>ARAM.&nbsp; Favours that are got by impudence and importunity,
are like discoveries from the rack, when the afflicted person,
for his ease, sometimes confesses secrets his heart knows nothing
of.</p>
<p>VAIN.&nbsp; I should rather think favours, so gained, to be
due rewards to indefatigable devotion.&nbsp; For as love is a
deity, he must be served by prayer.</p>
<p>BELIN.&nbsp; O Gad, would you would all pray to love, then,
and let us alone.</p>
<p>VAIN.&nbsp; You are the temples of love, and &rsquo;tis
through you, our devotion must be conveyed.</p>
<p>ARAM.&nbsp; Rather poor silly idols of your own making, which
upon the least displeasure you forsake and set up new.&nbsp;
Every man now changes his mistress and his religion as his humour
varies, or his interest.</p>
<p>VAIN.&nbsp; O madam&mdash;</p>
<p>ARAM.&nbsp; Nay, come, I find we are growing serious, and then
we are in great danger of being dull.&nbsp; If my music-master be
not gone, I&rsquo;ll entertain you with a new song, which comes
pretty near my own opinion of love and your sex.&nbsp;
Who&rsquo;s there?&nbsp; Is Mr. Gavot gone?&nbsp;
[<i>Calls</i>.]</p>
<p>FOOT.&nbsp; Only to the next door, madam.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll
call him.</p>
<h4>SCENE VIII.</h4>
<p><span class="smcap">Araminta</span>, <span
class="smcap">Belinda</span>, <span
class="smcap">Vainlove</span>, <i>and</i> <span
class="smcap">Bellmour</span>.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; Why, you won&rsquo;t hear me with patience.</p>
<p>ARAM.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s the matter, cousin?</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; Nothing, madam, only&mdash;</p>
<p>BELIN.&nbsp; Prithee hold thy tongue.&nbsp; Lard, he has so
pestered me with flames and stuff, I think I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t
endure the sight of a fire this twelvemonth.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; Yet all can&rsquo;t melt that cruel frozen
heart.</p>
<p>BELIN.&nbsp; O Gad, I hate your hideous fancy&mdash;you said
that once before&mdash;if you must talk impertinently, for
Heaven&rsquo;s sake let it be with variety; don&rsquo;t come
always, like the devil, wrapt in flames.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll not
hear a sentence more, that begins with an &lsquo;I
burn&rsquo;&mdash;or an &lsquo;I beseech you, madam.&rsquo;</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; But tell me how you would be adored.&nbsp; I am
very tractable.</p>
<p>BELIN.&nbsp; Then know, I would be adored in silence.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; Humph, I thought so, that you might have all the
talk to yourself.&nbsp; You had better let me speak; for if my
thoughts fly to any pitch, I shall make villainous signs.</p>
<p>BELIN.&nbsp; What will you get by that; to make such signs as
I won&rsquo;t understand?</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; Ay, but if I&rsquo;m tongue-tied, I must have all
my actions free to&mdash;quicken your apprehension&mdash;and
I&mdash;gad let me tell you, my most prevailing argument is
expressed in dumb show.</p>
<h4>SCENE IX.</h4>
<p>[<i>To them</i>] <span class="smcap">Music-Master</span>.</p>
<p>ARAM.&nbsp; Oh, I am glad we shall have a song to divert the
discourse.&nbsp; Pray oblige us with the last new song.</p>
<p>SONG.</p>
<p>I.</p>
<p>Thus to a ripe, consenting maid,<br />
Poor, old, repenting Delia said,<br />
Would you long preserve your lover?<br />
Would you still his goddess reign?<br />
Never let him all discover,<br />
Never let him much obtain.</p>
<p>II.</p>
<p>Men will admire, adore and die,<br />
While wishing at your feet they lie:<br />
But admitting their embraces,<br />
Wakes &rsquo;em from the golden dream;<br />
Nothing&rsquo;s new besides our faces,<br />
Every woman is the same.</p>
<p>ARAM.&nbsp; So, how de&rsquo;e like the song, gentlemen?</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; Oh, very well performed; but I don&rsquo;t much
admire the words.</p>
<p>ARAM.&nbsp; I expected it; there&rsquo;s too much truth in
&rsquo;em.&nbsp; If Mr. Gavot will walk with us in the garden,
we&rsquo;ll have it once again; you may like it better at second
hearing.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll bring my cousin.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; Faith, madam, I dare not speak to her, but
I&rsquo;ll make signs.&nbsp; [<i>Addresses Belinda in dumb
show</i>.]</p>
<p>BELIN.&nbsp; Oh, foh, your dumb rhetoric is more ridiculous
than your talking impertinence, as an ape is a much more
troublesome animal than a parrot.</p>
<p>ARAM.&nbsp; Ay, cousin, and &rsquo;tis a sign the creatures
mimic nature well; for there are few men but do more silly things
than they say.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; Well, I find my apishness has paid the ransom for
my speech, and set it at liberty&mdash;though, I confess, I could
be well enough pleased to drive on a love-bargain in that silent
manner&mdash;&rsquo;twould save a man a world of lying and
swearing at the year&rsquo;s end.&nbsp; Besides, I have had a
little experience, that brings to mind&mdash;</p>
<p>When wit and reason both have failed to move;<br />
Kind looks and actions (from success) do prove,<br />
Ev&rsquo;n silence may be eloquent in love.</p>
<h3>ACT III.</h3>
<h4>SCENE I.</h4>
<p>SCENE: <i>The Street</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Silvia</span> <i>and</i> <span
class="smcap">Lucy</span>.</p>
<p>SILV.&nbsp; Will he not come, then?</p>
<p>LUCY.&nbsp; Yes, yes; come, I warrant him, if you will go in
and be ready to receive him.</p>
<p>SILV.&nbsp; Why did you not tell me?&nbsp; Whom mean you?</p>
<p>LUCY.&nbsp; Whom you should mean, Heartwell.</p>
<p>SILV.&nbsp; Senseless creature, I meant my Vainlove.</p>
<p>LUCY.&nbsp; You may as soon hope to recover your own
maiden-head as his love.&nbsp; Therefore, e&rsquo;en set your
heart at rest, and in the name of opportunity mind your own
business.&nbsp; Strike Heartwell home before the bait&rsquo;s
worn off the hook.&nbsp; Age will come.&nbsp; He nibbled fairly
yesterday, and no doubt will be eager enough to-day to swallow
the temptation.</p>
<p>SILV.&nbsp; Well, since there&rsquo;s no remedy&mdash;yet tell
me&mdash;for I would know, though to the anguish of my soul, how
did he refuse?&nbsp; Tell me, how did he receive my
letter&mdash;in anger or in scorn?</p>
<p>LUCY.&nbsp; Neither; but what was ten times worse, with damned
senseless indifference.&nbsp; By this light I could have spit in
his face.&nbsp; Receive it!&nbsp; Why, he received it as I would
one of your lovers that should come empty-handed; as a court lord
does his mercer&rsquo;s bill or a begging dedication&mdash;he
received it as if &rsquo;t had been a letter from his wife.</p>
<p>SILV.&nbsp; What! did he not read it?</p>
<p>LUCY.&nbsp; Hummed it over, gave you his respects, and said he
would take time to peruse it&mdash;but then he was in haste.</p>
<p>SILV.&nbsp; Respects, and peruse it!&nbsp; He&rsquo;s gone,
and Araminta has bewitched him from me.&nbsp; Oh, how the name of
rival fires my blood.&nbsp; I could curse &rsquo;em both; eternal
jealousy attend her love, and disappointment meet his.&nbsp; Oh
that I could revenge the torment he has caused; methinks I feel
the woman strong within me, and vengeance kindles in the room of
love.</p>
<p>LUCY.&nbsp; I have that in my head may make mischief.</p>
<p>SILV.&nbsp; How, dear Lucy?</p>
<p>LUCY.&nbsp; You know Araminta&rsquo;s dissembled coyness has
won, and keeps him hers&mdash;</p>
<p>SILV.&nbsp; Could we persuade him that she loves
another&mdash;</p>
<p>LUCY.&nbsp; No, you&rsquo;re out; could we persuade him that
she dotes on him, himself.&nbsp; Contrive a kind letter as from
her, &rsquo;twould disgust his nicety, and take away his
stomach.</p>
<p>SILV.&nbsp; Impossible; &rsquo;twill never take.</p>
<p>LUCY.&nbsp; Trouble not your head.&nbsp; Let me alone&mdash;I
will inform myself of what passed between &rsquo;em to-day, and
about it straight.&nbsp; Hold, I&rsquo;m mistaken, or
that&rsquo;s Heartwell, who stands talking at the
corner&mdash;&rsquo;tis he&mdash;go get you in, madam, receive
him pleasantly, dress up your face in innocence and smiles, and
dissemble the very want of dissimulation.&nbsp; You know what
will take him.</p>
<p>SILV.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis as hard to counterfeit love as it is to
conceal it: but I&rsquo;ll do my weak endeavour, though I fear I
have not art.</p>
<p>LUCY.&nbsp; Hang art, madam, and trust to nature for
dissembling.</p>
<p>Man was by nature woman&rsquo;s cully made:<br />
We never are but by ourselves betrayed.</p>
<h4>SCENE II.</h4>
<p><span class="smcap">Heartwell</span>, <span
class="smcap">Vainlove</span> <i>and</i> <span
class="smcap">Bellmour</span> <i>following</i>.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; Hist, hist, is not that Heartwell going to
Silvia?</p>
<p>VAIN.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s talking to himself, I think; prithee
let&rsquo;s try if we can hear him.</p>
<p>HEART.&nbsp; Why, whither in the devil&rsquo;s name am I
agoing now?&nbsp; Hum&mdash;let me think&mdash;is not this
Silvia&rsquo;s house, the cave of that enchantress, and which
consequently I ought to shun as I would infection?&nbsp; To enter
here is to put on the envenomed shirt, to run into the embraces
of a fever, and in some raving fit, be led to plunge myself into
that more consuming fire, a woman&rsquo;s arms.&nbsp; Ha! well
recollected, I will recover my reason, and be gone.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; Now Venus forbid!</p>
<p>VAIN.&nbsp; Hush&mdash;</p>
<p>HEART.&nbsp; Well, why do you not move?&nbsp; Feet, do your
office&mdash;not one inch; no, fore Gad I&rsquo;m caught.&nbsp;
There stands my north, and thither my needle points.&nbsp; Now
could I curse myself, yet cannot repent.&nbsp; O thou delicious,
damned, dear, destructive woman!&nbsp; S&rsquo;death, how the
young fellows will hoot me!&nbsp; I shall be the jest of the
town: nay, in two days I expect to be chronicled in ditty, and
sung in woful ballad, to the tune of the Superannuated
Maiden&rsquo;s Comfort, or the Bachelor&rsquo;s Fall; and upon
the third, I shall be hanged in effigy, pasted up for the
exemplary ornament of necessary houses and cobblers&rsquo;
stalls.&nbsp; Death, I can&rsquo;t think
on&rsquo;t&mdash;I&rsquo;ll run into the danger to lose the
apprehension.</p>
<h4>SCENE III.</h4>
<p><span class="smcap">Bellmour</span>, <span
class="smcap">Vainlove</span>.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; A very certain remedy, probatum est.&nbsp; Ha, ha,
ha, poor George, thou art i&rsquo; th&rsquo; right, thou hast
sold thyself to laughter; the ill-natured town will find the jest
just where thou hast lost it.&nbsp; Ha, ha, how a&rsquo;
struggled, like an old lawyer between two fees.</p>
<p>VAIN.&nbsp; Or a young wench between pleasure and
reputation.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; Or as you did to-day, when half afraid you
snatched a kiss from Araminta.</p>
<p>VAIN.&nbsp; She has made a quarrel on&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; Pauh, women are only angry at such offences to
have the pleasure of forgiving them.</p>
<p>VAIN.&nbsp; And I love to have the pleasure of making my
peace.&nbsp; I should not esteem a pardon if too easily won.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; Thou dost not know what thou wouldst be at;
whether thou wouldst have her angry or pleased.&nbsp; Couldst
thou be content to marry Araminta?</p>
<p>VAIN.&nbsp; Could you be content to go to heaven?</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; Hum, not immediately, in my conscience not
heartily.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d do a little more good in my generation
first, in order to deserve it.</p>
<p>VAIN.&nbsp; Nor I to marry Araminta till I merit her.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; But how the devil dost thou expect to get her if
she never yield?</p>
<p>VAIN.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s true; but I would&mdash;</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; Marry her without her consent; thou &rsquo;rt a
riddle beyond woman&mdash;</p>
<h4>SCENE IV.</h4>
<p>[<i>To them</i>] <span class="smcap">Setter</span>.</p>
<p>Trusty Setter, what tidings?&nbsp; How goes the project?</p>
<p>SETTER.&nbsp; As all lewd projects do, sir, where the devil
prevents our endeavours with success.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; A good hearing, Setter.</p>
<p>VAIN.&nbsp; Well, I&rsquo;ll leave you with your engineer.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; And hast thou provided necessaries?</p>
<p>SETTER.&nbsp; All, all, sir; the large sanctified hat, and the
little precise band, with a swinging long spiritual cloak, to
cover carnal knavery&mdash;not forgetting the black patch, which
Tribulation Spintext wears, as I&rsquo;m informed, upon one eye,
as a penal mourning for the ogling offences of his youth; and
some say, with that eye he first discovered the frailty of his
wife.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; Well, in this fanatic father&rsquo;s habit will I
confess L&aelig;titia.</p>
<p>SETTER.&nbsp; Rather prepare her for confession, sir, by
helping her to sin.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; Be at your master&rsquo;s lodging in the evening;
I shall use the robes.</p>
<h4>SCENE V.</h4>
<p><span class="smcap">Setter</span> <i>alone</i>.</p>
<p>SETTER.&nbsp; I shall, sir.&nbsp; I wonder to which of these
two gentlemen I do most properly appertain: the one uses me as
his attendant; the other (being the better acquainted with my
parts) employs me as a pimp; why, that&rsquo;s much the more
honourable employment&mdash;by all means.&nbsp; I follow one as
my master, the other follows me as his conductor.</p>
<h4>SCENE VI.</h4>
<p>[<i>To him</i>] <span class="smcap">Lucy</span>.</p>
<p>LUCY.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s the hang-dog, his man&mdash;I had a
power over him in the reign of my mistress; but he is too true a
<i>Valet de Chambre</i> not to affect his master&rsquo;s faults,
and consequently is revolted from his allegiance.</p>
<p>SETTER.&nbsp; Undoubtedly &rsquo;tis impossible to be a pimp
and not a man of parts.&nbsp; That is without being politic,
diligent, secret, wary, and so forth&mdash;and to all this
valiant as Hercules&mdash;that is, passively valiant and actively
obedient.&nbsp; Ah, Setter, what a treasure is here lost for want
of being known.</p>
<p>LUCY.&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s some villainy afoot; he&rsquo;s so
thoughtful.&nbsp; May be I may discover something in my
mask.&nbsp; Worthy sir, a word with you.&nbsp; [<i>Puts on her
mask</i>.]</p>
<p>SETTER.&nbsp; Why, if I were known, I might come to be a great
man&mdash;</p>
<p>LUCY.&nbsp; Not to interrupt your meditation&mdash;</p>
<p>SETTER.&nbsp; And I should not be the first that has procured
his greatness by pimping.</p>
<p>LUCY.&nbsp; Now poverty and the pox light upon thee for a
contemplative pimp.</p>
<p>SETTER.&nbsp; Ha! what art who thus maliciously hast awakened
me from my dream of glory?&nbsp; Speak, thou vile
disturber&mdash;</p>
<p>LUCY.&nbsp; Of thy most vile cogitations&mdash;thou poor,
conceited wretch, how wert thou valuing thyself upon thy
master&rsquo;s employment?&nbsp; For he&rsquo;s the head pimp to
Mr. Bellmour.</p>
<p>SETTER.&nbsp; Good words, damsel, or I shall&mdash;But how
dost thou know my master or me?</p>
<p>LUCY.&nbsp; Yes; I know both master and man to be&mdash;</p>
<p>SETTER.&nbsp; To be men, perhaps; nay, faith, like enough: I
often march in the rear of my master, and enter the breaches
which he has made.</p>
<p>LUCY.&nbsp; Ay, the breach of faith, which he has begun: thou
traitor to thy lawful princess.</p>
<p>SETTER.&nbsp; Why, how now! prithee who art?&nbsp; Lay by that
worldly face and produce your natural vizor.</p>
<p>LUCY.&nbsp; No, sirrah, I&rsquo;ll keep it on to abuse thee
and leave thee without hopes of revenge.</p>
<p>SETTER.&nbsp; Oh!&nbsp; I begin to smoke ye: thou art some
forsaken Abigail we have dallied with heretofore&mdash;and art
come to tickle thy imagination with remembrance of iniquity
past.</p>
<p>LUCY.&nbsp; No thou pitiful flatterer of thy master&rsquo;s
imperfections; thou maukin made up of the shreds and parings of
his superfluous fopperies.</p>
<p>SETTER.&nbsp; Thou art thy mistress&rsquo;s foul self,
composed of her sullied iniquities and clothing.</p>
<p>LUCY.&nbsp; Hang thee, beggar&rsquo;s cur, thy master is but a
mumper in love, lies canting at the gate; but never dares presume
to enter the house.</p>
<p>SETTER.&nbsp; Thou art the wicket to thy mistress&rsquo;s
gate, to be opened for all comers.&nbsp; In fine thou art the
highroad to thy mistress.</p>
<p>LUCY.&nbsp; Beast, filthy toad, I can hold no longer, look and
tremble.&nbsp; [<i>Unmasks</i>.]</p>
<p>SETTER.&nbsp; How, Mrs. Lucy!</p>
<p>LUCY.&nbsp; I wonder thou hast the impudence to look me in the
face.</p>
<p>SETTER.&nbsp; Adsbud, who&rsquo;s in fault, mistress of mine?
who flung the first stone? who undervalued my function? and who
the devil could know you by instinct?</p>
<p>LUCY.&nbsp; You could know my office by instinct, and be
hanged, which you have slandered most abominably.&nbsp; It vexes
me not what you said of my person; but that my innocent calling
should be exposed and scandalised&mdash;I cannot bear it.</p>
<p>SETTER.&nbsp; Nay, faith, Lucy, I&rsquo;m sorry, I&rsquo;ll
own myself to blame, though we were both in fault as to our
offices&mdash;come, I&rsquo;ll make you any reparation.</p>
<p>LUCY.&nbsp; Swear.</p>
<p>SETTER.&nbsp; I do swear to the utmost of my power.</p>
<p>LUCY.&nbsp; To be brief, then; what is the reason your master
did not appear to-day according to the summons I brought him?</p>
<p>SETTER.&nbsp; To answer you as briefly&mdash;he has a cause to
be tried in another court.</p>
<p>LUCY.&nbsp; Come, tell me in plain terms, how forward he is
with Araminta.</p>
<p>SETTER.&nbsp; Too forward to be turned back&mdash;though
he&rsquo;s a little in disgrace at present about a kiss which he
forced.&nbsp; You and I can kiss, Lucy, without all that.</p>
<p>LUCY.&nbsp; Stand off&mdash;he&rsquo;s a precious jewel.</p>
<p>SETTER.&nbsp; And therefore you&rsquo;d have him to set in
your lady&rsquo;s locket.</p>
<p>LUCY.&nbsp; Where is he now?</p>
<p>SETTER.&nbsp; He&rsquo;ll be in the Piazza presently.</p>
<p>LUCY.&nbsp; Remember to-day&rsquo;s behaviour.&nbsp; Let me
see you with a penitent face.</p>
<p>SETTER.&nbsp; What, no token of amity, Lucy?&nbsp; You and I
don&rsquo;t use to part with dry lips.</p>
<p>LUCY.&nbsp; No, no, avaunt&mdash;I&rsquo;ll not be slabbered
and kissed now&mdash;I&rsquo;m not i&rsquo; th&rsquo; humour.</p>
<p>SETTER.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll not quit you so.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll
follow and put you into the humour.</p>
<h4>SCENE VII.</h4>
<p><span class="smcap">Sir Joseph Wittoll</span>, <span
class="smcap">Bluffe</span>.</p>
<p>BLUFF.&nbsp; And so, out of your unwonted
generosity&mdash;</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; And good-nature, Back; I am good-natured and I
can&rsquo;t help it.</p>
<p>BLUFF.&nbsp; You have given him a note upon Fondlewife for a
hundred pound.</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; Ay, ay, poor fellow; he ventured fair
for&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>BLUFF.&nbsp; You have disobliged me in it&mdash;for I have
occasion for the money, and if you would look me in the face
again and live, go, and force him to redeliver you the
note.&nbsp; Go, and bring it me hither.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll stay
here for you.</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; You may stay until the day of judgment, then, by
the Lord Harry.&nbsp; I know better things than to be run through
the guts for a hundred pounds.&nbsp; Why, I gave that hundred
pound for being saved, and de&rsquo;e think, an there were no
danger, I&rsquo;ll be so ungrateful to take it from the gentleman
again?</p>
<p>BLUFF.&nbsp; Well, go to him from me&mdash;tell him, I say, he
must refund&mdash;or Bilbo&rsquo;s the world, and slaughter will
ensue.&nbsp; If he refuse, tell him&mdash;but whisper
that&mdash;tell him&mdash;I&rsquo;ll pink his soul.&nbsp; But
whisper that softly to him.</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; So softly that he shall never hear on&rsquo;t, I
warrant you.&nbsp; Why, what a devil&rsquo;s the matter, Bully;
are you mad? or de&rsquo;e think I&rsquo;m mad?&nbsp; Agad, for
my part, I don&rsquo;t love to be the messenger of ill news;
&rsquo;tis an ungrateful office&mdash;so tell him yourself.</p>
<p>BLUFF.&nbsp; By these hilts I believe he frightened you into
this composition: I believe you gave it him out of fear, pure,
paltry fear&mdash;confess.</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; No, no, hang&rsquo;t; I was not afraid
neither&mdash;though I confess he did in a manner snap me
up&mdash;yet I can&rsquo;t say that it was altogether out of
fear, but partly to prevent mischief&mdash;for he was a devilish
choleric fellow.&nbsp; And if my choler had been up too, agad,
there would have been mischief done, that&rsquo;s flat.&nbsp; And
yet I believe if you had been by, I would as soon have let him
a&rsquo; had a hundred of my teeth.&nbsp; Adsheart, if he should
come just now when I&rsquo;m angry, I&rsquo;d tell
him&mdash;Mum.</p>
<h4>SCENE VIII.</h4>
<p>[<i>To them</i>] <span class="smcap">Bellmour</span>, <span
class="smcap">Sharper</span>.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; Thou &rsquo;rt a lucky rogue; there&rsquo;s your
benefactor; you ought to return him thanks now you have received
the favour.</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; Sir Joseph!&nbsp; Your note was accepted, and the
money paid at sight.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m come to return my
thanks&mdash;</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; They won&rsquo;t be accepted so readily as the
bill, sir.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; I doubt the knight repents, Tom.&nbsp; He looks
like the knight of the sorrowful face.</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; This is a double generosity: do me a kindness and
refuse my thanks.&nbsp; But I hope you are not offended that I
offered them.</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; May be I am, sir, may be I am not, sir, may be I
am both, sir; what then?&nbsp; I hope I may be offended without
any offence to you, sir.</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; Hey day!&nbsp; Captain, what&rsquo;s the
matter?&nbsp; You can tell.</p>
<p>BLUFF.&nbsp; Mr. Sharper, the matter is plain: Sir Joseph has
found out your trick, and does not care to be put upon, being a
man of honour.</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; Trick, sir?</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; Ay, trick, sir, and won&rsquo;t be put upon,
sir, being a man of honour, sir, and so, sir&mdash;</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; Harkee, Sir Joseph, a word with ye.&nbsp; In
consideration of some favours lately received, I would not have
you draw yourself into a <i>premunire</i>, by trusting to that
sign of a man there&mdash;that pot-gun charged with wind.</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; O Lord, O Lord, Captain, come justify
yourself&mdash;I&rsquo;ll give him the lie if you&rsquo;ll stand
to it.</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; Nay, then, I&rsquo;ll be beforehand with you,
take that, oaf.&nbsp; [<i>Cuffs him</i>.]</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; Captain, will you see this?&nbsp; Won&rsquo;t
you pink his soul?</p>
<p>BLUFF.&nbsp; Husht, &rsquo;tis not so convenient now&mdash;I
shall find a time.</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; What do you mutter about a time, rascal?&nbsp;
You were the incendiary.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s to put you in mind
of your time.&mdash;A memorandum.&nbsp; [<i>Kicks him</i>.]</p>
<p>BLUFF.&nbsp; Oh, this is your time, sir; you had best make use
on&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; I&mdash;Gad and so I will: there&rsquo;s again
for you.&nbsp; [<i>Kicks him</i>.]</p>
<p>BLUFF.&nbsp; You are obliging, sir, but this is too public a
place to thank you in.&nbsp; But in your ear, you are to be seen
again?</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; Ay, thou inimitable coward, and to be
felt&mdash;as for example.&nbsp; [<i>Kicks him</i>.]</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; Ha, ha, ha, prithee come away; &rsquo;tis
scandalous to kick this puppy unless a man were cold and had no
other way to get himself aheat.</p>
<h4>SCENE IX.</h4>
<p><span class="smcap">Sir Joseph</span>, <span
class="smcap">Bluffe</span>.</p>
<p>BLUFF.&nbsp; Very well&mdash;very fine&mdash;but &rsquo;tis no
matter.&nbsp; Is not this fine, Sir Joseph?</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; Indifferent, agad, in my opinion, very
indifferent.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d rather go plain all my life than
wear such finery.</p>
<p>BLUFF.&nbsp; Death and hell to be affronted thus!&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll die before I&rsquo;ll suffer it.&nbsp;
[<i>Draws</i>.]</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; O Lord, his anger was not raised before.&nbsp;
Nay, dear Captain, don&rsquo;t be in passion now he&rsquo;s
gone.&nbsp; Put up, put up, dear Back, &rsquo;tis your Sir Joseph
begs, come let me kiss thee; so, so, put up, put up.</p>
<p>BLUFF.&nbsp; By heaven, &rsquo;tis not to be put up.</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; What, Bully?</p>
<p>BLUFF.&nbsp; The affront.</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; No, aged, no more &rsquo;tis, for that&rsquo;s
put up all already; thy sword, I mean.</p>
<p>BLUFF.&nbsp; Well, Sir Joseph, at your entreaty&mdash;But were
not you, my friend, abused, and cuffed, and kicked?&nbsp;
[<i>Putting up his sword</i>.]</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; Ay, ay, so were you too; no matter, &rsquo;tis
past.</p>
<p>BLUFF.&nbsp; By the immortal thunder of great guns, &rsquo;tis
false&mdash;he sucks not vital air who dares affirm it to this
face.&nbsp; [<i>Looks big</i>.]</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; To that face I grant you, Captain.&nbsp; No, no,
I grant you&mdash;not to that face, by the Lord Harry.&nbsp; If
you had put on your fighting face before, you had done his
business&mdash;he durst as soon have kissed you, as kicked you to
your face.&nbsp; But a man can no more help what&rsquo;s done
behind his back than what&rsquo;s said&mdash;Come, we&rsquo;ll
think no more of what&rsquo;s past.</p>
<p>BLUFF.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll call a council of war within to
consider of my revenge to come.</p>
<h4>SCENE X.</h4>
<p><span class="smcap">Heartwell</span>, <span
class="smcap">Silvia</span>.&nbsp; <i>Silvia&rsquo;s
apartment</i>.</p>
<p>SONG.</p>
<p>As Amoret and Thyrsis lay<br />
Melting the hours in gentle play,<br />
Joining faces, mingling kisses,<br />
And exchanging harmless blisses:<br />
He trembling cried, with eager haste,<br />
O let me feed as well as taste,<br />
I die, if I&rsquo;m not wholly blest.</p>
<p>[<i>After the song a dance of antics</i>.]</p>
<p>SILV.&nbsp; Indeed it is very fine.&nbsp; I could look upon
&rsquo;em all day.</p>
<p>HEART.&nbsp; Well has this prevailed for me, and will you look
upon me?</p>
<p>SILV.&nbsp; If you could sing and dance so, I should love to
look upon you too.</p>
<p>HEART.&nbsp; Why, &rsquo;twas I sung and danced; I gave music
to the voice, and life to their measures.&nbsp; Look you here,
Silvia, [<i>pulling out a purse and chinking it</i>] here are
songs and dances, poetry and music&mdash;hark! how sweetly one
guinea rhymes to another&mdash;and how they dance to the music of
their own chink.&nbsp; This buys all t&rsquo;other&mdash;and this
thou shalt have; this, and all that I am worth, for the purchase
of thy love.&nbsp; Say, is it mine then, ha?&nbsp; Speak,
Syren&mdash;Oons, why do I look on her!&nbsp; Yet I must.&nbsp;
Speak, dear angel, devil, saint, witch; do not rack me with
suspense.</p>
<p>SILV.&nbsp; Nay, don&rsquo;t stare at me so.&nbsp; You make me
blush&mdash;I cannot look.</p>
<p>HEART.&nbsp; O manhood, where art thou?&nbsp; What am I come
to?&nbsp; A woman&rsquo;s toy, at these years!&nbsp; Death, a
bearded baby for a girl to dandle.&nbsp; O dotage, dotage!&nbsp;
That ever that noble passion, lust, should ebb to this
degree.&nbsp; No reflux of vigorous blood: but milky love
supplies the empty channels; and prompts me to the softness of a
child&mdash;a mere infant and would suck.&nbsp; Can you love me,
Silvia?&nbsp; Speak.</p>
<p>SILV.&nbsp; I dare not speak until I believe you, and indeed
I&rsquo;m afraid to believe you yet.</p>
<p>HEART.&nbsp; Death, how her innocence torments and pleases
me!&nbsp; Lying, child, is indeed the art of love, and men are
generally masters in it: but I&rsquo;m so newly entered, you
cannot distrust me of any skill in the treacherous mystery.&nbsp;
Now, by my soul, I cannot lie, though it were to serve a friend
or gain a mistress.</p>
<p>SILV.&nbsp; Must you lie, then, if you say you love me?</p>
<p>HEART.&nbsp; No, no, dear ignorance, thou beauteous
changeling&mdash;I tell thee I do love thee, and tell it for a
truth, a naked truth, which I&rsquo;m ashamed to discover.</p>
<p>SILV.&nbsp; But love, they say, is a tender thing, that will
smooth frowns, and make calm an angry face; will soften a rugged
temper, and make ill-humoured people good.&nbsp; You look ready
to fright one, and talk as if your passion were not love, but
anger.</p>
<p>HEART.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis both; for I am angry with myself when
I am pleased with you.&nbsp; And a pox upon me for loving thee so
well&mdash;yet I must on.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis a bearded arrow, and
will more easily be thrust forward than drawn back.</p>
<p>SILV.&nbsp; Indeed, if I were well assured you loved; but how
can I be well assured?</p>
<p>HEART.&nbsp; Take the symptoms&mdash;and ask all the tyrants
of thy sex if their fools are not known by this party-coloured
livery.&nbsp; I am melancholic when thou art absent; look like an
ass when thou art present; wake for thee when I should sleep; and
even dream of thee when I am awake; sigh much, drink little, eat
less, court solitude, am grown very entertaining to myself, and
(as I am informed) very troublesome to everybody else.&nbsp; If
this be not love, it is madness, and then it is pardonable.&nbsp;
Nay, yet a more certain sign than all this, I give thee my
money.</p>
<p>SILV.&nbsp; Ay, but that is no sign; for they say, gentlemen
will give money to any naughty woman to come to bed to
them.&nbsp; O Gemini, I hope you don&rsquo;t mean so&mdash;for I
won&rsquo;t be a whore.</p>
<p>HEART.&nbsp; The more is the pity.&nbsp; [<i>Aside</i>.]</p>
<p>SILV.&nbsp; Nay, if you would marry me, you should not come to
bed to me&mdash;you have such a beard, and would so prickle
one.&nbsp; But do you intend to marry me?</p>
<p>HEART.&nbsp; That a fool should ask such a malicious
question!&nbsp; Death, I shall be drawn in before I know where I
am.&nbsp; However, I find I am pretty sure of her consent, if I
am put to it.&nbsp; [<i>Aside</i>.]&nbsp; Marry you?&nbsp; No,
no, I&rsquo;ll love you.</p>
<p>SILV.&nbsp; Nay, but if you love me, you must marry me.&nbsp;
What, don&rsquo;t I know my father loved my mother and was
married to her?</p>
<p>HEART.&nbsp; Ay, ay, in old days people married where they
loved; but that fashion is changed, child.</p>
<p>SILV.&nbsp; Never tell me that; I know it is not changed by
myself: for I love you, and would marry you.</p>
<p>HEART.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll have my beard shaved, it
sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t hurt thee, and we&rsquo;ll go to
bed&mdash;</p>
<p>SILV.&nbsp; No, no, I&rsquo;m not such a fool neither, but I
can keep myself honest.&nbsp; Here, I won&rsquo;t keep anything
that&rsquo;s yours; I hate you now, [<i>throws the purse</i>] and
I&rsquo;ll never see you again, &rsquo;cause you&rsquo;d have me
be naught.&nbsp; [<i>Going</i>.]</p>
<p>HEART.&nbsp; Damn her, let her go, and a good riddance.&nbsp;
Yet so much tenderness and beauty and honesty together is a
jewel.&nbsp; Stay, Silvia&mdash;But then to marry; why, every man
plays the fool once in his life.&nbsp; But to marry is playing
the fool all one&rsquo;s life long.</p>
<p>SILV.&nbsp; What did you call me for?</p>
<p>HEART.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll give thee all I have, and thou shalt
live with me in everything so like my wife, the world shall
believe it.&nbsp; Nay, thou shalt think so thyself&mdash;only let
me not think so.</p>
<p>SILV.&nbsp; No, I&rsquo;ll die before I&rsquo;ll be your
whore&mdash;as well as I love you.</p>
<p>HEART.&nbsp; [<i>Aside</i>.]&nbsp; A woman, and ignorant, may
be honest, when &rsquo;tis out of obstinacy and
contradiction.&nbsp; But, s&rsquo;death, it is but a may be, and
upon scurvy terms.&nbsp; Well, farewell then&mdash;if I can get
out of sight I may get the better of myself.</p>
<p>SILV.&nbsp; Well&mdash;good-bye.&nbsp; [<i>Turns and
weeps</i>.]</p>
<p>HEART.&nbsp; Ha!&nbsp; Nay, come, we&rsquo;ll kiss at
parting.&nbsp; [<i>Kisses her</i>.]&nbsp; By heaven, her kiss is
sweeter than liberty.&nbsp; I will marry thee.&nbsp; There, thou
hast done&rsquo;t.&nbsp; All my resolves melted in that
kiss&mdash;one more.</p>
<p>SILV.&nbsp; But when?</p>
<p>HEART.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m impatient until it be done; I will not
give myself liberty to think, lest I should cool.&nbsp; I will
about a licence straight&mdash;in the evening expect me.&nbsp;
One kiss more to confirm me mad; so.</p>
<p>SILV.&nbsp; Ha, ha, ha, an old fox trapped&mdash;</p>
<h4>SCENE XI.</h4>
<p>[<i>To her</i>] <span class="smcap">Lucy</span>.</p>
<p>Bless me! you frighted me; I thought he had been come again,
and had heard me.</p>
<p>LUCY.&nbsp; Lord, madam, I met your lover in as much haste as
if he had been going for a midwife.</p>
<p>SILV.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s going for a parson, girl, the
forerunner of a midwife, some nine months hence.&nbsp; Well, I
find dissembling to our sex is as natural as swimming to a negro;
we may depend upon our skill to save us at a plunge, though till
then, we never make the experiment.&nbsp; But how hast thou
succeeded?</p>
<p>LUCY.&nbsp; As you would wish&mdash;since there is no
reclaiming Vainlove.&nbsp; I have found out a pique she has taken
at him, and have framed a letter that makes her sue for
reconciliation first.&nbsp; I know that will do&mdash;walk in and
I&rsquo;ll show it you.&nbsp; Come, madam, you&rsquo;re like to
have a happy time on&rsquo;t; both your love and anger
satisfied!&nbsp; All that can charm our sex conspire to please
you.</p>
<p>That woman sure enjoys a blessed night,<br />
Whom love and vengeance both at once delight.</p>

<p>BELL.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis pretty near the hour.&nbsp; [<i>Looking
on his watch</i>.]&nbsp; Well, and how, Setter, hae, does my
hypocrisy fit me, hae?&nbsp; Does it sit easy on me?</p>
<p>SET.&nbsp; Oh, most religiously well, sir.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; I wonder why all our young fellows should glory in
an opinion of atheism, when they may be so much more conveniently
lewd under the coverlet of religion.</p>
<p>SET.&nbsp; S&rsquo;bud, sir, away quickly: there&rsquo;s
Fondlewife just turned the corner, and &rsquo;s coming this
way.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; Gad&rsquo;s so, there he is: he must not see
me.</p>
<h4>SCENE II.</h4>
<p><span class="smcap">Fondlewife</span>, <span

<p>FOND.&nbsp; I say I will tarry at home.</p>
<p>BAR.&nbsp; But, sir.</p>
<p>FOND.&nbsp; Good lack!&nbsp; I profess the spirit of
contradiction hath possessed the lad&mdash;I say I will tarry at
home, varlet.</p>
<p>BAR.&nbsp; I have done, sir; then farewell five hundred
pound.</p>
<p>FOND.&nbsp; Ha, how&rsquo;s that?&nbsp; Stay, stay, did you
leave word, say you, with his wife?&nbsp; With Comfort
herself?</p>
<p>BAR.&nbsp; I did; and Comfort will send Tribulation hither as
soon as ever he comes home.&nbsp; I could have brought young Mr.
Prig to have kept my mistress company in the meantime.&nbsp; But
you say&mdash;</p>
<p>FOND.&nbsp; How, how, say, varlet!&nbsp; I say let him not
come near my doors.&nbsp; I say, he is a wanton young Levite, and
pampereth himself up with dainties, that he may look lovely in
the eyes of women.&nbsp; Sincerely, I am afraid he hath already
defiled the tabernacle of our sister Comfort; while her good
husband is deluded by his godly appearance.&nbsp; I say that even
lust doth sparkle in his eyes and glow upon his cheeks, and that
I would as soon trust my wife with a lord&rsquo;s high-fed
chaplain.</p>
<p>BAR.&nbsp; Sir, the hour draws nigh, and nothing will be done
here until you come.</p>
<p>FOND.&nbsp; And nothing can be done here until I go; so that
I&rsquo;ll tarry, de&rsquo;e see.</p>
<p>BAR.&nbsp; And run the hazard to lose your affair, sir!</p>
<p>FOND.&nbsp; Good lack, good lack&mdash;I profess it is a very
sufficient vexation for a man to have a handsome wife.</p>
<p>BAR.&nbsp; Never, sir, but when the man is an insufficient
husband.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis then, indeed, like the vanity of taking
a fine house, and yet be forced to let lodgings to help pay the
rent.</p>
<p>FOND.&nbsp; I profess a very apt comparison, varlet.&nbsp; Go
and bid my Cocky come out to me; I will give her some
instructions, I will reason with her before I go.</p>
<h4>SCENE III.</h4>
<p><span class="smcap">Fondlewife</span> <i>alone</i>.</p>
<p>And in the meantime I will reason with myself.&nbsp; Tell me,
Isaac, why art thee jealous?&nbsp; Why art thee distrustful of
the wife of thy bosom?&nbsp; Because she is young and vigorous,
and I am old and impotent.&nbsp; Then why didst thee marry,
Isaac?&nbsp; Because she was beautiful and tempting, and because
I was obstinate and doting; so that my inclination was (and is
still) greater than my power.&nbsp; And will not that which
tempted thee, also tempt others, who will tempt her, Isaac?&nbsp;
I fear it much.&nbsp; But does not thy wife love thee, nay, dote
upon thee?&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; Why then!&nbsp; Ay, but to say truth,
she&rsquo;s fonder of me than she has reason to be; and in the
way of trade, we still suspect the smoothest dealers of the
deepest designs.&nbsp; And that she has some designs deeper than
thou canst reach, thou hast experimented, Isaac.&nbsp; But,
mum.</p>

<p>L&AElig;T.&nbsp; I hope my dearest jewel is not going to leave
me&mdash;are you, Nykin?</p>
<p>FOND.&nbsp; Wife&mdash;have you thoroughly considered how
detestable, how heinous, and how crying a sin the sin of adultery
is?&nbsp; Have you weighed it, I say?&nbsp; For it is a very
weighty sin; and although it may lie heavy upon thee, yet thy
husband must also bear his part.&nbsp; For thy iniquity will fall
upon his head.</p>
<p>L&AElig;T.&nbsp; Bless me, what means my dear?</p>
<p>FOND.&nbsp; [<i>Aside</i>.]&nbsp; I profess she has an
alluring eye; I am doubtful whether I shall trust her, even with
Tribulation himself.&nbsp; Speak, I say, have you considered what
it is to cuckold your husband?</p>
<p>L&AElig;T.&nbsp; [<i>Aside</i>.]&nbsp; I&rsquo;m amazed.&nbsp;
Sure he has discovered nothing.&nbsp; Who has wronged me to my
dearest?&nbsp; I hope my jewel does not think that ever I had any
such thing in my head, or ever will have.</p>
<p>FOND.&nbsp; No, no, I tell you I shall have it in my
head&mdash;</p>
<p>L&AElig;T.&nbsp; [<i>Aside</i>.]&nbsp; I know not what to
think.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;m resolved to find the meaning of
it.&nbsp; Unkind dear!&nbsp; Was it for this you sent to call
me?&nbsp; Is it not affliction enough that you are to leave me,
but you must study to increase it by unjust suspicions?&nbsp;
[<i>Crying</i>.]&nbsp; Well&mdash;well&mdash;you know my
fondness, and you love to tyrannise&mdash;Go on, cruel man, do:
triumph over my poor heart while it holds, which cannot be long,
with this usage of yours.&nbsp; But that&rsquo;s what you
want.&nbsp; Well, you will have your ends soon.&nbsp; You
will&mdash;you will.&nbsp; Yes, it will break to oblige
you.&nbsp; [<i>Sighs</i>.]</p>
<p>FOND.&nbsp; Verily, I fear I have carried the jest too
far.&nbsp; Nay, look you now if she does not
weep&mdash;&rsquo;tis the fondest fool.&nbsp; Nay, Cocky, Cocky,
nay, dear Cocky, don&rsquo;t cry, I was but in jest, I was not,
ifeck.</p>
<p>L&AElig;T.&nbsp; [<i>Aside</i>.]&nbsp; Oh then, all&rsquo;s
safe.&nbsp; I was terribly frighted.&nbsp; My affliction is
always your jest, barbarous man!&nbsp; Oh, that I should love to
this degree!&nbsp; Yet&mdash;</p>
<p>FOND.&nbsp; Nay, Cocky.</p>
<p>L&AElig;T.&nbsp; No, no, you are weary of me, that&rsquo;s
it&mdash;that&rsquo;s all, you would get another
wife&mdash;another fond fool, to break her heart&mdash;Well, be
as cruel as you can to me, I&rsquo;ll pray for you; and when I am
dead with grief, may you have one that will love you as well as I
have done: I shall be contented to lie at peace in my cold
grave&mdash;since it will please you.&nbsp; [<i>Sighs</i>.]</p>
<p>FOND.&nbsp; Good lack, good lack, she would melt a heart of
oak&mdash;I profess I can hold no longer.&nbsp; Nay, dear
Cocky&mdash;ifeck, you&rsquo;ll break my heart&mdash;ifeck you
will.&nbsp; See, you have made me weep&mdash;made poor Nykin
weep.&nbsp; Nay, come kiss, buss poor Nykin&mdash;and I
won&rsquo;t leave thee&mdash;I&rsquo;ll lose all first.</p>
<p>L&AElig;T.&nbsp; [<i>Aside</i>.]&nbsp; How!&nbsp; Heaven
forbid! that will be carrying the jest too far indeed.</p>
<p>FOND.&nbsp; Won&rsquo;t you kiss Nykin?</p>
<p>L&AElig;T.&nbsp; Go, naughty Nykin, you don&rsquo;t love
me.</p>
<p>FOND.&nbsp; Kiss, kiss, ifeck, I do.</p>
<p>L&AElig;T.&nbsp; No, you don&rsquo;t.&nbsp; [<i>She kisses
him</i>.]</p>
<p>FOND.&nbsp; What, not love Cocky!</p>
<p>L&AElig;T.&nbsp; No-h.&nbsp; [<i>Sighs</i>.]</p>
<p>FOND.&nbsp; I profess I do love thee better than five hundred
pound&mdash;and so thou shalt say, for I&rsquo;ll leave it to
stay with thee.</p>
<p>L&AElig;T.&nbsp; No you sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t neglect your
business for me.&nbsp; No, indeed, you sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t,
Nykin.&nbsp; If you don&rsquo;t go, I&rsquo;ll think you been
dealous of me still.</p>
<p>FOND.&nbsp; He, he, he, wilt thou, poor fool?&nbsp; Then I
will go, I won&rsquo;t be dealous.&nbsp; Poor Cocky, kiss Nykin,
kiss Nykin, ee, ee, ee.&nbsp; Here will be the good man anon, to
talk to Cocky and teach her how a wife ought to behave
herself.</p>
<p>L&AElig;T.&nbsp; [<i>Aside</i>.]&nbsp; I hope to have one that
will show me how a husband ought to behave himself.&nbsp; I shall
be glad to learn, to please my jewel.&nbsp; [<i>Kiss</i>.]</p>
<p>FOND.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s my good dear.&nbsp; Come, kiss Nykin
once more, and then get you in.&nbsp; So&mdash;get you in, get
you in.&nbsp; Bye, bye.</p>
<p>L&AElig;T.&nbsp; Bye, Nykin.</p>
<p>FOND.&nbsp; Bye, Cocky.</p>
<p>L&AElig;T.&nbsp; Bye, Nykin.</p>
<p>FOND.&nbsp; Bye, Cocky, bye, bye.</p>
<h4>SCENE V.</h4>
<p><span class="smcap">Vainlove</span>, <span
class="smcap">Sharper</span>.</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; How!&nbsp; Araminta lost!</p>
<p>VAIN.&nbsp; To confirm what I have said, read this.&nbsp;
[<i>Gives a letter</i>.]</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; [<i>Reads</i>.]&nbsp; Hum, hum!&nbsp; And what
then appeared a fault, upon reflection seems only an effect of a
too powerful passion.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m afraid I give too great a
proof of my own at this time.&nbsp; I am in disorder for what I
have written.&nbsp; But something, I know not what, forced
me.&nbsp; I only beg a favourable censure of this and your
ARAMINTA.</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; Lost!&nbsp; Pray heaven thou hast not lost thy
wits.&nbsp; Here, here, she&rsquo;s thy own, man, signed and
sealed too.&nbsp; To her, man&mdash;a delicious melon, pure and
consenting ripe, and only waits thy cutting up: she has been
breeding love to thee all this while, and just now she&rsquo;s
delivered of it.</p>
<p>VAIN.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis an untimely fruit, and she has
miscarried of her love.</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; Never leave this damned ill-natured whimsey,
Frank?&nbsp; Thou hast a sickly, peevish appetite; only chew love
and cannot digest it.</p>
<p>VAIN.&nbsp; Yes, when I feed myself.&nbsp; But I hate to be
crammed.&nbsp; By heaven, there&rsquo;s not a woman will give a
man the pleasure of a chase: my sport is always balked or cut
short.&nbsp; I stumble over the game I would pursue.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis dull and unnatural to have a hare run full in the
hounds&rsquo; mouth, and would distaste the keenest hunter.&nbsp;
I would have overtaken, not have met, my game.</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; However, I hope you don&rsquo;t mean to forsake
it; that will be but a kind of mongrel cur&rsquo;s trick.&nbsp;
Well, are you for the Mall?</p>
<p>VAIN.&nbsp; No; she will be there this evening.&nbsp; Yes, I
will go too, and she shall see her error in&mdash;</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; In her choice, I-gad.&nbsp; But thou canst not be
so great a brute as to slight her.</p>
<p>VAIN.&nbsp; I should disappoint her if I did not.&nbsp; By her
management I should think she expects it.</p>
<p>All naturally fly what does pursue:<br />
&rsquo;Tis fit men should be coy when women woo.</p>
<h4>SCENE VI.</h4>
<p><i>A Room in Fondlewife&rsquo;s House</i>.</p>
<p>A <span class="smcap">Servant</span> <i>introducing</i> <span

patch upon one eye and a book in his hand</i>.</p>
<p>SERV.&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s a chair, sir, if you please to repose
yourself.&nbsp; My mistress is coming, sir.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; Secure in my disguise I have out-faced suspicion
and even dared discovery.&nbsp; This cloak my sanctity, and
trusty Scarron&rsquo;s novels my prayer-book; methinks I am the
very picture of Montufar in the Hypocrites.&nbsp; Oh! she
comes.</p>
<h4>SCENE VII.</h4>
<p><span class="smcap">Bellmour</span>, <span

<p>So breaks Aurora through the veil of night,<br />
Thus fly the clouds, divided by her light,<br />
And every eye receives a new-born sight.<br />
[<i>Throwing off his cloak</i>, <i>patch</i>, <i>etc.</i>]</p>
<p>L&AElig;T.&nbsp; Thus strewed with blushes,
like&mdash;Ah!&nbsp; Heaven defend me!&nbsp; Who&rsquo;s
this?&nbsp; [<i>Discovering him</i>, <i>starts</i>.]</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; Your lover.</p>
<p>L&AElig;T.&nbsp; Vainlove&rsquo;s friend!&nbsp; I know his
face, and he has betrayed me to him.&nbsp; [<i>Aside</i>.]</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; You are surprised.&nbsp; Did you not expect a
lover, madam?&nbsp; Those eyes shone kindly on my first
appearance, though now they are o&rsquo;ercast.</p>
<p>L&AElig;T.&nbsp; I may well be surprised at your person and
impudence: they are both new to me.&nbsp; You are not what your
first appearance promised: the piety of your habit was welcome,
but not the hypocrisy.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; Rather the hypocrisy was welcome, but not the
hypocrite.</p>
<p>L&AElig;T.&nbsp; Who are you, sir?&nbsp; You have mistaken the
house sure.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; I have directions in my pocket which agree with
everything but your unkindness.&nbsp; [<i>Pulls out the
letter</i>.]</p>
<p>L&AElig;T.&nbsp; My letter!&nbsp; Base Vainlove!&nbsp; Then
&rsquo;tis too late to dissemble.&nbsp; [<i>Aside</i>.]&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis plain, then, you have mistaken the person.&nbsp;
[<i>Going</i>.]</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; If we part so I&rsquo;m mistaken.&nbsp; Hold,
hold, madam!&nbsp; I confess I have run into an error.&nbsp; I
beg your pardon a thousand times.&nbsp; What an eternal blockhead
am I!&nbsp; Can you forgive me the disorder I have put you
into?&nbsp; But it is a mistake which anybody might have
made.</p>
<p>L&AElig;T.&nbsp; What can this mean?&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis
impossible he should be mistaken after all this.&nbsp; A handsome
fellow if he had not surprised me.&nbsp; Methinks, now I look on
him again, I would not have him mistaken.&nbsp;
[<i>Aside</i>.]&nbsp; We are all liable to mistakes, sir.&nbsp;
If you own it to be so, there needs no farther apology.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; Nay, faith, madam, &rsquo;tis a pleasant one, and
worth your hearing.&nbsp; Expecting a friend last night, at his
lodgings, till &rsquo;twas late, my intimacy with him gave me the
freedom of his bed.&nbsp; He not coming home all night, a letter
was delivered to me by a servant in the morning.&nbsp; Upon the
perusal I found the contents so charming that I could think of
nothing all day but putting &rsquo;em in practice, until just
now, the first time I ever looked upon the superscription, I am
the most surprised in the world to find it directed to Mr.
Vainlove.&nbsp; Gad, madam, I ask you a million of pardons, and
will make you any satisfaction.</p>
<p>L&AElig;T.&nbsp; I am discovered.&nbsp; And either Vainlove is
not guilty, or he has handsomely excused him.&nbsp;
[<i>Aside</i>.]</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; You appear concerned, madam.</p>
<p>L&AElig;T.&nbsp; I hope you are a gentleman;&mdash;and since
you are privy to a weak woman&rsquo;s failing, won&rsquo;t turn
it to the prejudice of her reputation.&nbsp; You look as if you
had more honour&mdash;</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; And more love, or my face is a false witness and
deserves to be pilloried.&nbsp; No, by heaven, I swear&mdash;</p>
<p>L&AElig;T.&nbsp; Nay, don&rsquo;t swear if you&rsquo;d have me
believe you; but promise&mdash;</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; Well, I promise.&nbsp; A promise is so cold: give
me leave to swear, by those eyes, those killing eyes, by those
healing lips.&nbsp; Oh! press the soft charm close to mine, and
seal &rsquo;em up for ever.</p>
<p>L&AElig;T.&nbsp; Upon that condition.&nbsp; [<i>He kisses
her</i>.]</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; Eternity was in that moment.&nbsp; One more, upon
any condition!</p>
<p>L&AElig;T.&nbsp; Nay, now&mdash;I never saw anything so
agreeably impudent.&nbsp; [<i>Aside</i>.]&nbsp; Won&rsquo;t you
censure me for this, now?&mdash;but &rsquo;tis to buy your
silence.&nbsp; [<i>Kiss</i>.]&nbsp; Oh, but what am I doing!</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; Doing!&nbsp; No tongue can express it&mdash;not
thy own, nor anything, but thy lips.&nbsp; I am faint with the
excess of bliss.&nbsp; Oh, for love-sake, lead me anywhither,
where I may lie down &mdash;quickly, for I&rsquo;m afraid I shall
have a fit.</p>
<p>L&AElig;T.&nbsp; Bless me!&nbsp; What fit?</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; Oh, a convulsion&mdash;I feel the symptoms.</p>
<p>L&AElig;T.&nbsp; Does it hold you long?&nbsp; I&rsquo;m afraid
to carry you into my chamber.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; Oh, no: let me lie down upon the bed; the fit will
be soon over.</p>
<h4>SCENE VIII.</h4>
<p>SCENE: <i>St. James&rsquo;s Park</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Araminta</span> <i>and</i> <span
class="smcap">Belinda</span> <i>meeting</i>.</p>
<p>BELIN.&nbsp; Lard, my dear, I am glad I have met you; I have
been at the Exchange since, and am so tired&mdash;</p>
<p>ARAM.&nbsp; Why, what&rsquo;s the matter?</p>
<p>BELIN.&nbsp; Oh the most inhuman, barbarous
hackney-coach!&nbsp; I am jolted to a jelly.&nbsp; Am I not
horribly touzed?&nbsp; [<i>Pulls out a pocket-glass</i>.]</p>
<p>ARAM.&nbsp; Your head&rsquo;s a little out of order.</p>
<p>BELIN.&nbsp; A little!&nbsp; O frightful!&nbsp; What a furious
phiz I have!&nbsp; O most rueful!&nbsp; Ha, ha, ha.&nbsp; O Gad,
I hope nobody will come this way, till I have put myself a little
in repair.&nbsp; Ah! my dear, I have seen such unhewn creatures
since.&nbsp; Ha, ha, ha.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t for my soul help
thinking that I look just like one of &rsquo;em.&nbsp; Good dear,
pin this, and I&rsquo;ll tell you&mdash;very well&mdash;so, thank
you, my dear&mdash;but as I was telling you&mdash;pish, this is
the untowardest lock&mdash;so, as I was telling you&mdash;how
d&rsquo;ye like me now?&nbsp; Hideous, ha?&nbsp; Frightful
still?&nbsp; Or how?</p>
<p>ARAM.&nbsp; No, no; you&rsquo;re very well as can be.</p>
<p>BELIN.&nbsp; And so&mdash;but where did I leave off, my
dear?&nbsp; I was telling you&mdash;</p>
<p>ARAM.&nbsp; You were about to tell me something, child, but
you left off before you began.</p>
<p>BELIN.&nbsp; Oh; a most comical sight: a country squire, with
the equipage of a wife and two daughters, came to Mrs.
Snipwel&rsquo;s shop while I was there&mdash;but oh Gad! two such
unlicked cubs!</p>
<p>ARAM.&nbsp; I warrant, plump, cherry-cheeked country
girls.</p>
<p>BELIN.&nbsp; Ay, o&rsquo; my conscience, fat as barn-door
fowl: but so bedecked, you would have taken &rsquo;em for
Friesland hens, with their feathers growing the wrong way.&nbsp;
O such outlandish creatures!&nbsp; Such Tramontan&aelig;, and
foreigners to the fashion, or anything in practice!&nbsp; I had
not patience to behold.&nbsp; I undertook the modelling of one of
their fronts, the more modern structure&mdash;</p>
<p>ARAM.&nbsp; Bless me, cousin; why would you affront anybody
so?&nbsp; They might be gentlewomen of a very good
family&mdash;</p>
<p>BELIN.&nbsp; Of a very ancient one, I dare swear, by their
dress.&nbsp; Affront! pshaw, how you&rsquo;re mistaken!&nbsp; The
poor creature, I warrant, was as full of curtsies, as if I had
been her godmother.&nbsp; The truth on&rsquo;t is, I did
endeavour to make her look like a Christian&mdash;and she was
sensible of it, for she thanked me, and gave me two apples,
piping hot, out of her under-petticoat pocket.&nbsp; Ha, ha, ha:
and t&rsquo;other did so stare and gape, I fancied her like the
front of her father&rsquo;s hall; her eyes were the two
jut-windows, and her mouth the great door, most hospitably kept
open for the entertainment of travelling flies.</p>
<p>ARAM.&nbsp; So then, you have been diverted.&nbsp; What did
they buy?</p>
<p>BELIN.&nbsp; Why, the father bought a powder-horn, and an
almanac, and a comb-case; the mother, a great fruz-towr, and a
fat amber necklace; the daughters only tore two pairs of
kid-leather gloves, with trying &rsquo;em on.&nbsp; O Gad, here
comes the fool that dined at my Lady Freelove&rsquo;s
t&rsquo;other day.</p>
<h4>SCENE IX.</h4>
<p>[<i>To them</i>] <span class="smcap">Sir Joseph</span>
<i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Bluffe</span>.</p>
<p>ARAM.&nbsp; May be he may not know us again.</p>
<p>BELIN.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll put on our masks to secure his
ignorance.&nbsp; [<i>They put on their masks</i>.]</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; Nay, Gad, I&rsquo;ll pick up; I&rsquo;m resolved
to make a night on&rsquo;t.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll go to Alderman
Fondlewife by and by, and get fifty pieces more from him.&nbsp;
Adslidikins, bully, we&rsquo;ll wallow in wine and women.&nbsp;
Why, this same Madeira wine has made me as light as a
grasshopper.&nbsp; Hist, hist, bully, dost thou see those
tearers?&nbsp; [<i>Sings</i>.]&nbsp; Look you what here
is&mdash;look you what here
is&mdash;toll&mdash;loll&mdash;dera&mdash;toll&mdash;loll&mdash;agad,
t&rsquo;other glass of Madeira, and I durst have attacked
&rsquo;em in my own proper person, without your help.</p>
<p>BLUFF.&nbsp; Come on then, knight.&nbsp; But do you know what
to say to them?</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; Say: pooh, pox, I&rsquo;ve enough to
say&mdash;never fear it&mdash;that is, if I can but think
on&rsquo;t: truth is, I have but a treacherous memory.</p>
<p>BELIN.&nbsp; O frightful! cousin, what shall we do?&nbsp;
These things come towards us.</p>
<p>ARAM.&nbsp; No matter.&nbsp; I see Vainlove coming this
way&mdash;and, to confess my failing, I am willing to give him an
opportunity of making his peace with me&mdash;and to rid me of
these coxcombs, when I seem opprest with &rsquo;em, will be a
fair one.</p>
<p>BLUFF.&nbsp; Ladies, by these hilts you are well met.</p>
<p>ARAM.&nbsp; We are afraid not.</p>
<p>BLUFF.&nbsp; What says my pretty little knapsack
carrier.&nbsp; [<i>To</i> <span
class="smcap">Belinda</span>.]</p>
<p>BELIN.&nbsp; O monstrous filthy fellow! good slovenly Captain
Huffe, Bluffe (what is your hideous name?) be gone: you stink of
brandy and tobacco, most soldier-like.&nbsp; Foh.&nbsp;
[<i>Spits</i>.]</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; Now am I slap-dash down in the mouth, and have
not one word to say!&nbsp; [<i>Aside</i>.]</p>
<p>ARAM.&nbsp; I hope my fool has not confidence enough to be
troublesome.&nbsp; [<i>Aside</i>.]</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; Hem!&nbsp; Pray, madam, which way is the
wind?</p>
<p>ARAM.&nbsp; A pithy question.&nbsp; Have you sent your wits
for a venture, sir, that you enquire?</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; Nay, now I&rsquo;m in, I can prattle like a
magpie.&nbsp; [<i>Aside</i>.]</p>
<h4>SCENE X.</h4>
<p>[<i>To them</i>] <span class="smcap">Sharper</span> <i>and</i>
<span class="smcap">Vainlove</span> <i>at some distance</i>.</p>
<p>BELIN.&nbsp; Dear Araminta, I&rsquo;m tired.</p>
<p>ARAM.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis but pulling off our masks, and obliging
Vainlove to know us.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll be rid of my fool by fair
means.&mdash;Well, Sir Joseph, you shall see my face; but, be
gone immediately.&nbsp; I see one that will be jealous, to find
me in discourse with you.&nbsp; Be discreet.&nbsp; No reply; but
away.&nbsp; [<i>Unmasks</i>.]</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; The great fortune, that dined at my Lady
Freelove&rsquo;s!&nbsp; Sir Joseph, thou art a made man.&nbsp;
Agad, I&rsquo;m in love up to the ears.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;ll be
discreet, and hushed.&nbsp; [<i>Aside</i>.]</p>
<p>BLUFF.&nbsp; Nay, by the world, I&rsquo;ll see your face.</p>
<p>BELIN.&nbsp; You shall.&nbsp; [<i>Unmasks</i>.]</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; Ladies, your humble servant.&nbsp; We were afraid
you would not have given us leave to know you.</p>
<p>ARAM.&nbsp; We thought to have been private.&nbsp; But we find
fools have the same advantage over a face in a mask that a coward
has while the sword is in the scabbard, so were forced to draw in
our own defence.</p>
<p>BLUFF.&nbsp; My blood rises at that fellow: I can&rsquo;t stay
where he is; and I must not draw in the park.&nbsp; [<i>To</i>
<span class="smcap">Sir Joseph</span>.]</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; I wish I durst stay to let her know my
lodging.</p>
<h4>SCENE XI.</h4>
<p>ARAMINTA, BELINDA, VAINLOVE, SHARPER.</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; There is in true beauty, as in courage, somewhat
which narrow souls cannot dare to admire.&nbsp; And see, the owls
are fled, as at the break of day.</p>
<p>BELIN.&nbsp; Very courtly.&nbsp; I believe Mr. Vainlove has
not rubbed his eyes since break of day neither, he looks as if he
durst not approach.&nbsp; Nay, come, cousin, be friends with
him.&nbsp; I swear he looks so very simply&mdash;ha, ha,
ha.&nbsp; Well, a lover in the state of separation from his
mistress is like a body without a soul.&nbsp; Mr. Vainlove, shall
I be bound for your good behaviour for the future?</p>
<p>VAIN.&nbsp; Now must I pretend ignorance equal to hers, of
what she knows as well as I.&nbsp; [<i>Aside</i>.]&nbsp; Men are
apt to offend (&rsquo;tis true) where they find most goodness to
forgive.&nbsp; But, madam, I hope I shall prove of a temper not
to abuse mercy by committing new offences.</p>
<p>ARAM.&nbsp; So cold!&nbsp; [<i>Aside</i>.]</p>
<p>BELIN.&nbsp; I have broke the ice for you, Mr. Vainlove, and
so I leave you.&nbsp; Come, Mr. Sharper, you and I will take a
turn, and laugh at the vulgar&mdash;both the great vulgar and the
small.&nbsp; O Gad!&nbsp; I have a great passion for
Cowley.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you admire him?</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; Oh, madam! he was our English Horace.</p>
<p>BELIN.&nbsp; Ah so fine! so extremely fine!&nbsp; So
everything in the world that I like&mdash;O Lord, walk this
way&mdash;I see a couple; I&rsquo;ll give you their history.</p>
<h4>SCENE XII.</h4>
<p><span class="smcap">Araminta</span>, <span
class="smcap">Vainlove</span>.</p>
<p>VAIN.&nbsp; I find, madam, the formality of the law must be
observed, though the penalty of it be dispensed with, and an
offender must plead to his arraignment, though he has his pardon
in his pocket.</p>
<p>ARAM.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m amazed!&nbsp; This insolence exceeds
t&rsquo;other; whoever has encouraged you to this assurance,
presuming upon the easiness of my temper, has much deceived you,
and so you shall find.</p>
<p>VAIN.&nbsp; Hey day!&nbsp; Which way now?&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s
fine doubling.&nbsp; [<i>Aside</i>.]</p>
<p>ARAM.&nbsp; Base man!&nbsp; Was it not enough to affront me
with your saucy passion?</p>
<p>VAIN.&nbsp; You have given that passion a much kinder epithet
than saucy, in another place.</p>
<p>ARAM.&nbsp; Another place!&nbsp; Some villainous design to
blast my honour.&nbsp; But though thou hadst all the treachery
and malice of thy sex, thou canst not lay a blemish on my
fame.&nbsp; No, I have not erred in one favourable thought of
mankind.&nbsp; How time might have deceived me in you, I know
not; my opinion was but young, and your early baseness has
prevented its growing to a wrong belief.&nbsp; Unworthy and
ungrateful! be gone, and never see me more.</p>
<p>VAIN.&nbsp; Did I dream? or do I dream?&nbsp; Shall I believe
my eyes, or ears?&nbsp; The vision is here still.&nbsp; Your
passion, madam, will admit of no farther reasoning; but
here&rsquo;s a silent witness of your acquaintance.&nbsp;
[<i>Takes our the letter</i>, <i>and offers it</i>: <i>she
snatches it</i>, <i>and throws it away</i>.]</p>
<p>ARAM.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s poison in everything you
touch.&nbsp; Blisters will follow&mdash;</p>
<p>VAIN.&nbsp; That tongue, which denies what the hands have
done.</p>
<p>ARAM.&nbsp; Still mystically senseless and impudent; I find I
must leave the place.</p>
<p>VAIN.&nbsp; No, madam, I&rsquo;m gone.&nbsp; She knows her
name&rsquo;s to it, which she will be unwilling to expose to the
censure of the first finder.</p>
<p>ARAM.&nbsp; Woman&rsquo;s obstinacy made me blind to what
woman&rsquo;s curiosity now tempts me to see.&nbsp; [<i>Takes up
the letter</i>.]</p>

class="smcap">Sharper</span>.</p>
<p>BELIN.&nbsp; Nay, we have spared nobody, I swear.&nbsp; Mr.
Sharper, you&rsquo;re a pure man; where did you get this
excellent talent of railing?</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; Faith, madam, the talent was born with
me:&mdash;I confess I have taken care to improve it, to qualify
me for the society of ladies.</p>
<p>BELIN.&nbsp; Nay, sure, railing is the best qualification in a
woman&rsquo;s man.</p>

<p>[<i>To them</i>] <span class="smcap">Footman</span>.</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; The second best, indeed, I think.</p>
<p>BELIN.&nbsp; How now, Pace?&nbsp; Where&rsquo;s my cousin?</p>
<p>FOOT.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s not very well, madam, and has sent to
know if your ladyship would have the coach come again for
you?</p>
<p>BELIN.&nbsp; O Lord, no, I&rsquo;ll go along with her.&nbsp;
Come, Mr. Sharper.</p>

<p>L&AElig;T.&nbsp; Methinks &rsquo;t has been very ill
weather.</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; As you say, madam, &rsquo;tis pretty bad
weather, and has been so a great while.</p>
<h4>SCENE XVIII.</h4>
<p>[<i>To them</i>] <span class="smcap">Fondlewife</span>.</p>
<p>FOND.&nbsp; Here are fifty pieces in this purse, Sir Joseph;
if you will tarry a moment, till I fetch my papers, I&rsquo;ll
wait upon you down-stairs.</p>
<p>L&AElig;T.&nbsp; Ruined, past redemption! what shall I
do&mdash;ha! this fool may be of use.&nbsp; (Aside.)&nbsp;
[<i>As</i> <span class="smcap">Fondlewife</span> <i>is going into
the chamber</i>, <i>she runs to</i> <span class="smcap">Sir
Joseph</span>, <i>almost pushes him down</i>, <i>and cries
out</i>.]&nbsp; Stand off, rude ruffian.&nbsp; Help me, my
dear.&nbsp; O bless me!&nbsp; Why will you leave me alone with
such a Satyr?</p>
<p>FOND.&nbsp; Bless us!&nbsp; What&rsquo;s the matter?&nbsp;
What&rsquo;s the matter?</p>
<p>L&AElig;T.&nbsp; Your back was no sooner turned, but like a
lion he came open mouthed upon me, and would have ravished a kiss
from me by main force.</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; O Lord!&nbsp; Oh, terrible!&nbsp; Ha, ha,
ha.&nbsp; Is your wife mad, Alderman?</p>
<p>L&AElig;T.&nbsp; Oh!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sick with the fright;
won&rsquo;t you take him out of my sight?</p>
<p>FOND.&nbsp; O traitor!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m astonished.&nbsp; O
bloody-minded traitor!</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; Hey-day!&nbsp; Traitor yourself.&nbsp; By the
Lord Harry, I was in most danger of being ravished, if you go to
that.</p>
<p>FOND.&nbsp; Oh, how the blasphemous wretch swears!&nbsp; Out
of my house, thou son of the whore of Babylon; offspring of Bel
and the Dragon.&mdash;Bless us! ravish my wife! my Dinah!&nbsp;
Oh, Shechemite!&nbsp; Begone, I say.</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; Why, the devil&rsquo;s in the people, I
think.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">L&aelig;titia</span>, <span
class="smcap">Fondlewife</span>.</p>
<p>L&AElig;T.&nbsp; Oh! won&rsquo;t you follow, and see him out
of doors, my dear?</p>
<p>FOND.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll shut this door to secure him from
coming back&mdash;Give me the key of your cabinet, Cocky.&nbsp;
Ravish my wife before my face?&nbsp; I warrant he&rsquo;s a
Papist in his heart at least, if not a Frenchman.</p>
<p>L&AElig;T.&nbsp; What can I do now!&nbsp; (Aside.)&nbsp; Oh!
my dear, I have been in such a fright, that I forgot to tell you,
poor Mr. Spintext has a sad fit of the colic, and is forced to
lie down upon our bed&mdash;you&rsquo;ll disturb him; I can tread
softlier.</p>
<p>FOND.&nbsp; Alack, poor man&mdash;no, no&mdash;you don&rsquo;t
know the papers&mdash;I won&rsquo;t disturb him; give me the
key.&nbsp; [<i>She gives him the key</i>, <i>goes to the chamber
door and speaks aloud</i>.]</p>
<p>L&AElig;T.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis nobody but Mr. Fondlewife, Mr.
Spintext, lie still on your stomach; lying on your stomach will
ease you of the colic.</p>
<p>FOND.&nbsp; Ay, ay, lie still, lie still; don&rsquo;t let me
disturb you.</p>
<h4>SCENE XX.</h4>
<p><span class="smcap">L&aelig;titia</span> <i>alone</i>.</p>
<p>L&AElig;T.&nbsp; Sure, when he does not see his face, he
won&rsquo;t discover him.&nbsp; Dear fortune, help me but this
once, and I&rsquo;ll never run in thy debt again.&nbsp; But this
opportunity is the Devil.</p>
<h4>SCENE XXI.</h4>
<p><span class="smcap">Fondlewife</span> <i>returns with
Papers</i>.</p>
<p>FOND.&nbsp; Good lack! good lack!&nbsp; I profess the poor man
is in great torment; he lies as flat&mdash;Dear, you should heat
a trencher, or a napkin.&mdash;Where&rsquo;s Deborah?&nbsp; Let
her clap some warm thing to his stomach, or chafe it with a warm
hand rather than fail.&nbsp; What book&rsquo;s this?&nbsp;
[<i>Sees the book that</i> <span class="smcap">Bellmour</span>
<i>forgot</i>.]</p>
<p>L&AElig;T.&nbsp; Mr. Spintext&rsquo;s prayer-book, dear.&nbsp;
Pray Heaven it be a prayer-book.&nbsp; [<i>Aside</i>.]</p>
<p>FOND.&nbsp; Good man!&nbsp; I warrant he dropped it on purpose
that you might take it up and read some of the pious
ejaculations.&nbsp; [<i>Taking up the book</i>.]&nbsp; O bless
me!&nbsp; O monstrous!&nbsp; A prayer-book?&nbsp; Ay, this is the
devil&rsquo;s paternoster.&nbsp; Hold, let me see: The Innocent
Adultery.</p>
<p>L&AElig;T.&nbsp; Misfortune! now all&rsquo;s ruined
again.&nbsp; [<i>Aside</i>.]</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; [<i>Peeping</i>].&nbsp; Damned chance!&nbsp; If I
had gone a-whoring with the Practice of Piety in my pocket I had
never been discovered.</p>
<p>FOND.&nbsp; Adultery, and innocent!&nbsp; O Lord!&nbsp;
Here&rsquo;s doctrine!&nbsp; Ay, here&rsquo;s discipline!</p>
<p>L&AElig;T.&nbsp; Dear husband, I&rsquo;m amazed.&nbsp; Sure it
is a good book, and only tends to the speculation of sin.</p>
<p>FOND.&nbsp; Speculation!&nbsp; No no; something went farther
than speculation when I was not to be let in.&mdash;Where is this
apocryphal elder?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll ferret him.</p>
<p>L&AElig;T.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m so distracted, I can&rsquo;t think
of a lie.&nbsp; [<i>Aside</i>.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">L&aelig;titia</span> <i>and</i> <span

<p>FOND.&nbsp; Come out here, thou Ananias incarnate.&nbsp; Who,
how now!&nbsp; Who have we here?</p>
<p>L&AElig;T.&nbsp; Ha!&nbsp; [<i>Shrieks as surprised</i>.]</p>
<p>FOND.&nbsp; Oh thou salacious woman!&nbsp; Am I then
brutified?&nbsp; Ay, I feel it here; I sprout, I bud, I blossom,
I am ripe-horn-mad.&nbsp; But who in the devil&rsquo;s name are
you?&nbsp; Mercy on me for swearing.&nbsp; But&mdash;</p>
<p>L&AElig;T.&nbsp; Oh! goodness keep us!&nbsp; Who are
you?&nbsp; What are you?</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; Soh!</p>
<p>L&AElig;T.&nbsp; In the name of the&mdash;O!&nbsp; Good, my
dear, don&rsquo;t come near it; I&rsquo;m afraid &rsquo;tis the
devil; indeed, it has hoofs, dear.</p>
<p>FOND.&nbsp; Indeed, and I have horns, dear.&nbsp; The devil,
no, I am afraid &rsquo;tis the flesh, thou harlot.&nbsp; Dear,
with the pox.&nbsp; Come Syren, speak, confess, who is this
reverend, brawny pastor.</p>
<p>L&AElig;T.&nbsp; Indeed, and indeed now, my dear Nykin, I
never saw this wicked man before.</p>
<p>FOND.&nbsp; Oh, it is a man then, it seems.</p>
<p>L&AElig;T.&nbsp; Rather, sure it is a wolf in the clothing of
a sheep.</p>
<p>FOND.&nbsp; Thou art a devil in his proper
clothing&mdash;woman&rsquo;s flesh.&nbsp; What, you know nothing
of him, but his fleece here!&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t love mutton?
you Magdalen unconverted.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; Well, now, I know my cue.&mdash;That is, very
honourably to excuse her, and very impudently accuse
myself.&nbsp; [<i>Aside</i>.]</p>
<p>L&AElig;T.&nbsp; Why then, I wish I may never enter into the
heaven of your embraces again, my dear, if ever I saw his face
before.</p>
<p>FOND.&nbsp; O Lord!&nbsp; O strange!&nbsp; I am in admiration
of your impudence.&nbsp; Look at him a little better; he is more
modest, I warrant you, than to deny it.&nbsp; Come, were you two
never face to face before?&nbsp; Speak.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; Since all artifice is vain.&nbsp; And I think
myself obliged to speak the truth in justice to your
wife.&mdash;No.</p>
<p>FOND.&nbsp; Humph.</p>
<p>L&AElig;T.&nbsp; No, indeed, dear.</p>
<p>FOND.&nbsp; Nay, I find you are both in a story; that I must
confess.&nbsp; But, what&mdash;not to be cured of the
colic?&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you know your patient, Mrs. Quack?&nbsp;
Oh, &lsquo;lie upon your stomach; lying upon your stomach will
cure you of the colic.&rsquo;&nbsp; Ah! answer me, Jezebel?</p>
<p>L&AElig;T.&nbsp; Let the wicked man answer for himself: does
he think I have nothing to do but excuse him? &rsquo;tis enough
if I can clear my own innocence to my own dear.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; By my troth, and so &rsquo;tis.&nbsp; I have been
a little too backward; that&rsquo;s the truth on&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>FOND.&nbsp; Come, sir, who are you, in the first place?&nbsp;
And what are you?</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; A whore-master.</p>
<p>FOND.&nbsp; Very concise.</p>
<p>L&AElig;T.&nbsp; O beastly, impudent creature.</p>
<p>FOND.&nbsp; Well, sir, and what came you hither for?</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; To lie with your wife.</p>
<p>FOND.&nbsp; Good again.&nbsp; A very civil person this, and I
believe speaks truth.</p>
<p>L&AElig;T.&nbsp; Oh, insupportable impudence.</p>
<p>FOND.&nbsp; Well, sir; pray be covered&mdash;and you
have&mdash;Heh!&nbsp; You have finished the matter, heh?&nbsp;
And I am, as I should be, a sort of civil perquisite to a
whore-master, called a cuckold, heh?&nbsp; Is it not so?&nbsp;
Come, I&rsquo;m inclining to believe every word you say.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; Why, faith, I must confess, so I designed you; but
you were a little unlucky in coming so soon, and hindered the
making of your own fortune.</p>
<p>FOND.&nbsp; Humph.&nbsp; Nay, if you mince the matter once and
go back of your word you are not the person I took you for.&nbsp;
Come, come, go on boldly.&mdash;What, don&rsquo;t be ashamed of
your profession.&mdash;Confess, confess; I shall love thee the
better for&rsquo;t.&nbsp; I shall, i&rsquo;feck.&nbsp; What, dost
think I don&rsquo;t know how to behave myself in the employment
of a cuckold, and have been three years apprentice to
matrimony?&nbsp; Come, come; plain dealing is a jewel.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; Well, since I see thou art a good, honest fellow,
I&rsquo;ll confess the whole matter to thee.</p>
<p>FOND.&nbsp; Oh, I am a very honest fellow.&nbsp; You never lay
with an honester man&rsquo;s wife in your life.</p>
<p>L&AElig;T.&nbsp; How my heart aches!&nbsp; All my comfort lies
in his impudence, and heaven be praised, he has a considerable
portion.&nbsp; [<i>Aside</i>.]</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; In short, then, I was informed of the opportunity
of your absence by my spy (for faith, honest Isaac, I have a long
time designed thee this favour).&nbsp; I knew Spintext was to
come by your direction.&nbsp; But I laid a trap for him, and
procured his habit, in which I passed upon your servants, and was
conducted hither.&nbsp; I pretended a fit of the colic, to excuse
my lying down upon your bed; hoping that when she heard of it,
her good nature would bring her to administer remedies for my
distemper.&nbsp; You know what might have followed.&nbsp; But,
like an uncivil person, you knocked at the door before your wife
was come to me.</p>
<p>FOND.&nbsp; Ha!&nbsp; This is apocryphal; I may choose whether
I will believe it or no.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; That you may, faith, and I hope you won&rsquo;t
believe a word on&rsquo;t&mdash;but I can&rsquo;t help telling
the truth, for my life.</p>
<p>FOND.&nbsp; How! would not you have me believe you, say
you?</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; No; for then you must of consequence part with
your wife, and there will be some hopes of having her upon the
public; then the encouragement of a separate
maintenance&mdash;</p>
<p>FOND.&nbsp; No, no; for that matter, when she and I part,
she&rsquo;ll carry her separate maintenance about her.</p>
<p>L&AElig;T.&nbsp; Ah, cruel dear, how can you be so
barbarous?&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll break my heart, if you talk of
parting.&nbsp; [<i>Cries</i>.]</p>
<p>FOND.&nbsp; Ah, dissembling vermin!</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; How can&rsquo;st thou be so cruel, Isaac?&nbsp;
Thou hast the heart of a mountain-tiger.&nbsp; By the faith of a
sincere sinner, she&rsquo;s innocent for me.&nbsp; Go to him,
madam, fling your snowy arms about his stubborn neck; bathe his
relentless face in your salt trickling tears.&nbsp; [<i>She goes
and hangs upon his neck</i>, <i>and kisses him</i>.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">Bellmour</span> <i>kisses her hand behind</i> <span
class="smcap">Fondlewife&rsquo;s</span> <i>back</i>.]&nbsp; So, a
few soft words, and a kiss, and the good man melts.&nbsp; See how
kind nature works, and boils over in him.</p>
<p>L&AElig;T.&nbsp; Indeed, my dear, I was but just come down
stairs, when you knocked at the door; and the maid told me Mr.
Spintext was ill of the colic upon our bed.&nbsp; And won&rsquo;t
you speak to me, cruel Nykin?&nbsp; Indeed, I&rsquo;ll die, if
you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>FOND.&nbsp; Ah!&nbsp; No, no, I cannot speak, my heart&rsquo;s
so full&mdash;I have been a tender husband, a tender yoke-fellow;
you know I have.&mdash;But thou hast been a faithless Delilah,
and the Philistines&mdash;Heh!&nbsp; Art thou not vile and
unclean, heh?&nbsp; Speak.&nbsp; [<i>Weeping</i>.]</p>
<p>L&AElig;T.&nbsp; No-h.&nbsp; [<i>Sighing</i>.]</p>
<p>FOND.&nbsp; Oh that I could believe thee!</p>
<p>L&AElig;T.&nbsp; Oh, my heart will break.&nbsp; [<i>Seeming to
faint</i>.]</p>
<p>FOND.&nbsp; Heh, how!&nbsp; No, stay, stay, I will believe
thee, I will.&nbsp; Pray bend her forward, sir.</p>
<p>L&AElig;T.&nbsp; Oh! oh!&nbsp; Where is my dear?</p>
<p>FOND.&nbsp; Here, here; I do believe thee.&nbsp; I won&rsquo;t
believe my own eyes.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; For my part, I am so charmed with the love of your
turtle to you, that I&rsquo;ll go and solicit matrimony with all
my might and main.</p>
<p>FOND.&nbsp; Well, well, sir; as long as I believe it,
&rsquo;tis well enough.&nbsp; No thanks to you, sir, for her
virtue.&mdash;But, I&rsquo;ll show you the way out of my house,
if you please.&nbsp; Come, my dear.&nbsp; Nay, I will believe
thee, I do, i&rsquo;feck.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; See the great blessing of an easy faith; opinion
cannot err.</p>
<blockquote><p>No husband, by his wife, can be deceived;<br />
She still is virtuous, if she&rsquo;s so believed.</p>

<p>BELL.&nbsp; Setter!&nbsp; Well encountered.</p>
<p>SET.&nbsp; Joy of your return, sir.&nbsp; Have you made a good
voyage? or have you brought your own lading back?</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; No, I have brought nothing but ballast
back&mdash;made a delicious voyage, Setter; and might have rode
at anchor in the port till this time, but the enemy surprised
us&mdash;I would unrig.</p>
<p>SET.&nbsp; I attend you, sir.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; Ha!&nbsp; Is it not that Heartwell at
Sylvia&rsquo;s door?&nbsp; Be gone quickly, I&rsquo;ll follow
you&mdash;I would not be known.&nbsp; Pox take &rsquo;em, they
stand just in my way.</p>
<h4>SCENE II.</h4>
<p><span class="smcap">Bellmour</span>, <span
class="smcap">Heartwell</span>, <span
class="smcap">Lucy</span>.</p>
<p>HEART.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m impatient till it be done.</p>
<p>LUCY.&nbsp; That may be, without troubling yourself to go
again for your brother&rsquo;s chaplain.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you
see that stalking form of godliness?</p>
<p>HEART.&nbsp; O ay; he&rsquo;s a fanatic.</p>
<p>LUCY.&nbsp; An executioner qualified to do your
business.&nbsp; He has been lawfully ordained.</p>
<p>HEART.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll pay him well, if you&rsquo;ll break
the matter to him.</p>
<p>LUCY.&nbsp; I warrant you.&mdash;Do you go and prepare your
bride.</p>
<h4>SCENE III.</h4>
<p><span class="smcap">Bellmour</span>, <span
class="smcap">Lucy</span>.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; Humph, sits the wind there?&nbsp; What a lucky
rogue am I!&nbsp; Oh, what sport will be here, if I can persuade
this wench to secrecy!</p>
<p>LUCY.&nbsp; Sir: reverend sir.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; Madam.&nbsp; [<i>Discovers himself</i>.]</p>
<p>LUCY.&nbsp; Now, goodness have mercy upon me!&nbsp; Mr.
Bellmour! is it you?</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; Even I.&nbsp; What dost think?</p>
<p>LUCY.&nbsp; Think!&nbsp; That I should not believe my eyes,
and that you are not what you seem to be.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; True.&nbsp; But to convince thee who I am, thou
knowest my old token.&nbsp; [<i>Kisses her</i>.]</p>
<p>LUCY.&nbsp; Nay, Mr. Bellmour: O Lard!&nbsp; I believe you are
a parson in good earnest, you kiss so devoutly.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; Well, your business with me, Lucy?</p>
<p>LUCY.&nbsp; I had none, but through mistake.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; Which mistake you must go through with,
Lucy.&nbsp; Come, I know the intrigue between Heartwell and your
mistress; and you mistook me for Tribulation Spintext, to marry
&rsquo;em&mdash;Ha? are not matters in this posture?&nbsp;
Confess: come, I&rsquo;ll be faithful; I will,
i&rsquo;faith.&nbsp; What! diffide in me, Lucy?</p>
<p>LUCY.&nbsp; Alas-a-day!&nbsp; You and Mr. Vainlove, between
you, have ruined my poor mistress: you have made a gap in her
reputation; and can you blame her if she make it up with a
husband?</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; Well, is it as I say?</p>
<p>LUCY.&nbsp; Well, it is then: but you&rsquo;ll be secret?</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; Phuh, secret, ay.&nbsp; And to be out of thy debt,
I&rsquo;ll trust thee with another secret.&nbsp; Your mistress
must not marry Heartwell, Lucy.</p>
<p>LUCY.&nbsp; How!&nbsp; O Lord!</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; Nay, don&rsquo;t be in passion,
Lucy:&mdash;I&rsquo;ll provide a fitter husband for her.&nbsp;
Come, here&rsquo;s earnest of my good intentions for thee too;
let this mollify.&nbsp; [<i>Gives her money</i>.]&nbsp; Look you,
Heartwell is my friend; and though he be blind, I must not see
him fall into the snare, and unwittingly marry a whore.</p>
<p>LUCY.&nbsp; Whore!&nbsp; I&rsquo;d have you to know my
mistress scorns&mdash;</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; Nay, nay: look you, Lucy; there are whores of as
good quality.&nbsp; But to the purpose, if you will give me leave
to acquaint you with it.&nbsp; Do you carry on the mistake of me:
I&rsquo;ll marry &rsquo;em.&nbsp; Nay, don&rsquo;t pause; if you
do, I&rsquo;ll spoil all.&nbsp; I have some private reasons for
what I do, which I&rsquo;ll tell you within.&nbsp; In the
meantime, I promise&mdash;and rely upon me&mdash;to help your
mistress to a husband: nay, and thee too, Lucy.&nbsp;
Here&rsquo;s my hand, I will; with a fresh assurance.&nbsp;
[<i>Gives her more money</i>.]</p>
<p>LUCY.&nbsp; Ah, the devil is not so cunning.&nbsp; You know my
easy nature.&nbsp; Well, for once I&rsquo;ll venture to serve
you; but if you do deceive me, the curse of all kind,
tender-hearted women light upon you!</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s as much as to say, the pox take
me.&nbsp; Well, lead on.</p>
<h4>SCENE IV.</h4>
<p><span class="smcap">Vainlove</span>, <span
class="smcap">Sharper</span>, <i>and</i> <span
class="smcap">Setter</span>.</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; Just now, say you; gone in with Lucy?</p>
<p>SET.&nbsp; I saw him, sir, and stood at the corner where you
found me, and overheard all they said: Mr. Bellmour is to marry
&rsquo;em.</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; Ha, ha; it will be a pleasant cheat.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll plague Heartwell when I see him.&nbsp; Prithee, Frank,
let&rsquo;s tease him; make him fret till he foam at the mouth,
and disgorge his matrimonial oath with interest.&nbsp; Come,
thou&rsquo;rt musty&mdash;</p>
<p>SET.&nbsp; [<i>To</i> <span
class="smcap">Sharper</span>.]&nbsp; Sir, a word with you.&nbsp;
[<i>Whispers him</i>.]</p>
<p>VAIN.&nbsp; Sharper swears she has forsworn the
letter&mdash;I&rsquo;m sure he tells me truth;&mdash;but
I&rsquo;m not sure she told him truth: yet she was unaffectedly
concerned, he says, and often blushed with anger and surprise:
and so I remember in the park.&nbsp; She had reason, if I wrong
her.&nbsp; I begin to doubt.</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; Say&rsquo;st thou so?</p>
<p>SET.&nbsp; This afternoon, sir, about an hour before my master
received the letter.</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; In my conscience, like enough.</p>
<p>SET.&nbsp; Ay, I know her, sir; at least, I&rsquo;m sure I can
fish it out of her: she&rsquo;s the very sluice to her
lady&rsquo;s secrets: &rsquo;tis but setting her mill agoing, and
I can drain her of &rsquo;em all.</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; Here, Frank, your bloodhound has made out the
fault: this letter, that so sticks in thy maw, is counterfeit;
only a trick of Sylvia in revenge, contrived by Lucy.</p>
<p>VAIN.&nbsp; Ha!&nbsp; It has a colour; but how do you know it,
sirrah?</p>
<p>SET.&nbsp; I do suspect as much; because why, sir, she was
pumping me about how your worship&rsquo;s affairs stood towards
Madam Araminta; as, when you had seen her last? when you were to
see her next? and, where you were to be found at that time? and
such like.</p>
<p>VAIN.&nbsp; And where did you tell her?</p>
<p>SET.&nbsp; In the Piazza.</p>
<p>VAIN.&nbsp; There I received the letter&mdash;it must be
so&mdash;and why did you not find me out, to tell me this before,
sot?</p>
<p>SET.&nbsp; Sir, I was pimping for Mr. Bellmour.</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; You were well employed: I think there is no
objection to the excuse.</p>
<p>VAIN.&nbsp; Pox of my saucy credulity&mdash;if I have lost
her, I deserve it.&nbsp; But if confession and repentance be of
force, I&rsquo;ll win her, or weary her into a forgiveness.</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; Methinks I long to see Bellmour come forth.</p>
<h4>SCENE V.</h4>
<p><span class="smcap">Sharper</span>, <span
class="smcap">Bellmour</span>, <span
class="smcap">Setter</span>.</p>
<p>SET.&nbsp; Talk of the devil: see where he comes.</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; Hugging himself in his prosperous
mischief&mdash;no real fanatic can look better pleased after a
successful sermon of sedition.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; Sharper!&nbsp; Fortify thy spleen: such a
jest!&nbsp; Speak when thou art ready.</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; Now, were I ill-natured would I utterly
disappoint thy mirth: hear thee tell thy mighty jest with as much
gravity as a bishop hears venereal causes in the spiritual
court.&nbsp; Not so much as wrinkle my face with one smile; but
let thee look simply, and laugh by thyself.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; Pshaw, no; I have a better opinion of thy
wit.&nbsp; Gad, I defy thee.</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; Were it not loss of time you should make the
experiment.&nbsp; But honest Setter, here, overheard you with
Lucy, and has told me all.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; Nay, then, I thank thee for not putting me out of
countenance.&nbsp; But, to tell you something you don&rsquo;t
know.&nbsp; I got an opportunity after I had married &rsquo;em,
of discovering the cheat to Sylvia.&nbsp; She took it at first,
as another woman would the like disappointment; but my promise to
make her amends quickly with another husband somewhat pacified
her.</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; But how the devil do you think to acquit yourself
of your promise?&nbsp; Will you marry her yourself?</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; I have no such intentions at present.&nbsp;
Prithee, wilt thou think a little for me?&nbsp; I am sure the
ingenious Mr. Setter will assist.</p>
<p>SET.&nbsp; O Lord, sir!</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll leave him with you, and go shift my
habit.</p>
<h4>SCENE VI.</h4>
<p><span class="smcap">Sharper</span>, <span
class="smcap">Setter</span>, <span class="smcap">Sir
Joseph</span>, and <span class="smcap">Bluffe</span>.</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; Heh!&nbsp; Sure fortune has sent this fool hither
on purpose.&nbsp; Setter, stand close; seem not to observe
&rsquo;em; and, hark ye.&nbsp; [<i>Whispers</i>.]</p>
<p>BLUFF.&nbsp; Fear him not.&nbsp; I am prepared for him now,
and he shall find he might have safer roused a sleeping lion.</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; Hush, hush! don&rsquo;t you see him?</p>
<p>BLUFF.&nbsp; Show him to me.&nbsp; Where is he?</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; Nay, don&rsquo;t speak so loud.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t jest as I did a little while ago.&nbsp; Look
yonder!&nbsp; Agad, if he should hear the lion roar, he&rsquo;d
cudgel him into an ass, and his primitive braying.&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t you remember the story in &AElig;sop&rsquo;s Fables,
bully?&nbsp; Agad, there are good morals to be picked out of
&AElig;sop&rsquo;s Fables, let me tell you that, and Reynard the
Fox too.</p>
<p>BLUFF.&nbsp; Damn your morals.</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; Prithee, don&rsquo;t speak so loud.</p>
<p>BLUFF.&nbsp; Damn your morals; I must revenge the affront done
to my honour.&nbsp; [<i>In a low voice</i>.]</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; Ay; do, do, captain, if you think fitting.&nbsp;
You may dispose of your own flesh as you think fitting,
d&rsquo;ye see, but, by the Lord Harry, I&rsquo;ll leave
you.&nbsp; [<i>Stealing away upon his tip-toes</i>.]</p>
<p>BLUFF.&nbsp; Prodigious!&nbsp; What, will you forsake your
friend in extremity?&nbsp; You can&rsquo;t in honour refuse to
carry him a challenge.&nbsp; [<i>Almost whispering</i>, <i>and
treading softly after him</i>.]</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; Prithee, what do you see in my face that looks
as if I would carry a challenge?&nbsp; Honour is your province,
captain; take it.&nbsp; All the world know me to be a knight, and
a man of worship.</p>
<p>SET.&nbsp; I warrant you, sir, I&rsquo;m instructed.</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; Impossible!&nbsp; Araminta take a liking to a
fool?&nbsp; [<i>Aloud</i>.]</p>
<p>SET.&nbsp; Her head runs on nothing else, nor she can talk of
nothing else.</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; I know she commanded him all the while we were in
the Park; but I thought it had been only to make Vainlove
jealous.</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; How&rsquo;s this!&nbsp; Good bully, hold your
breath and let&rsquo;s hearken.&nbsp; Agad, this must be I.</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; Death, it can&rsquo;t be.&nbsp; An oaf, an idiot,
a wittal.</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; Ay, now it&rsquo;s out; &rsquo;tis I, my own
individual person.</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; A wretch that has flown for shelter to the lowest
shrub of mankind, and seeks protection from a blasted coward.</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s you, bully back.&nbsp; [<span
class="smcap">Bluffe</span> <i>frowns upon</i> <span

<p>SHARP.&nbsp; She has given Vainlove her promise to marry him
before to-morrow morning.&nbsp; Has she not?&nbsp; [<i>To</i>
<span class="smcap">Setter</span>.]</p>
<p>SET.&nbsp; She has, sir; and I have it in charge to attend her
all this evening, in order to conduct her to the place
appointed.</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; Well, I&rsquo;ll go and inform your master; and
do you press her to make all the haste imaginable.</p>
<h4>SCENE VII.</h4>
<p><span class="smcap">Setter</span>, <span class="smcap">Sir
Joseph</span>, <span class="smcap">Bluffe</span>.</p>
<p>SET.&nbsp; Were I a rogue now, what a noble prize could I
dispose of!&nbsp; A goodly pinnace, richly laden, and to launch
forth under my auspicious convoy.&nbsp; Twelve thousand pounds
and all her rigging, besides what lies concealed under
hatches.&nbsp; Ha! all this committed to my care!&nbsp; Avaunt,
temptation!&nbsp; Setter, show thyself a person of worth; be true
to thy trust, and be reputed honest.&nbsp; Reputed honest!&nbsp;
Hum: is that all?&nbsp; Ay; for to be honest is nothing; the
reputation of it is all.&nbsp; Reputation! what have such poor
rogues as I to do with reputation? &rsquo;tis above us; and for
men of quality, they are above it; so that reputation is even as
foolish a thing as honesty.&nbsp; And, for my part, if I meet Sir
Joseph with a purse of gold in his hand, I&rsquo;ll dispose of
mine to the best advantage.</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; Heh, heh, heh: Here &rsquo;tis for you,
i&rsquo;faith, Mr. Setter.&nbsp; Nay, I&rsquo;ll take you at your
word.&nbsp; [<i>Chinking a purse</i>.]</p>
<p>SET.&nbsp; Sir Joseph and the captain, too! undone!
undone!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m undone, my master&rsquo;s undone, my
lady&rsquo;s undone, and all the business is undone.</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; No, no; never fear, man; the lady&rsquo;s
business shall be done.&nbsp; What, come, Mr. Setter, I have
overheard all, and to speak is but loss of time; but if there be
occasion, let these worthy gentlemen intercede for me.&nbsp;
[<i>Gives him gold</i>.]</p>
<p>SET.&nbsp; O lord, sir, what d&rsquo;ye mean?&nbsp; Corrupt my
honesty?&nbsp; They have indeed very persuading faces.&nbsp;
But&mdash;</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis too little, there&rsquo;s more,
man.&nbsp; There, take all.&nbsp; Now&mdash;</p>
<p>SET.&nbsp; Well, Sir Joseph, you have such a winning way with
you&mdash;</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; And how, and how, good Setter, did the little
rogue look when she talked of Sir Joseph?&nbsp; Did not her eyes
twinkle and her mouth water?&nbsp; Did not she pull up her little
bubbies?&nbsp; And&mdash;agad, I&rsquo;m so overjoyed&mdash;And
stroke down her belly? and then step aside to tie her garter when
she was thinking of her love?&nbsp; Heh, Setter!</p>
<p>SET.&nbsp; Oh, yes, sir.</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; How now, bully?&nbsp; What, melancholy because
I&rsquo;m in the lady&rsquo;s favour?&nbsp; No matter, I&rsquo;ll
make your peace: I know they were a little smart upon you.&nbsp;
But I warrant I&rsquo;ll bring you into the lady&rsquo;s good
graces.</p>
<p>BLUFF.&nbsp; Pshaw, I have petitions to show from other-guess
toys than she.&nbsp; Look here; these were sent me this
morning.&nbsp; There, read.&nbsp; [<i>Shows letters</i>].&nbsp;
That&mdash;that&rsquo;s a scrawl of quality.&nbsp; Here,
here&rsquo;s from a countess too.&nbsp; Hum&mdash;No,
hold&mdash;that&rsquo;s from a knight&rsquo;s wife&mdash;she sent
it me by her husband.&nbsp; But here, both these are from persons
of great quality.</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; They are either from persons of great quality,
or no quality at all, &rsquo;tis such a damned ugly hand.&nbsp;
[<i>While</i> <span class="smcap">Sir Joseph</span> <i>reads</i>,
<span class="smcap">Bluffe</span> <i>whispers</i> <span
class="smcap">Setter</span>.]</p>
<p>SET.&nbsp; Captain, I would do anything to serve you; but this
is so difficult.</p>
<p>BLUFF.&nbsp; Not at all.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t I know him?</p>
<p>SET.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll remember the conditions?</p>
<p>BLUFF.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll give it you under my hand.&nbsp; In
the meantime, here&rsquo;s earnest.&nbsp; [<i>Gives him
money</i>.]&nbsp; Come, knight, I&rsquo;m capitulating with Mr.
Setter for you.</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; Ah, honest Setter; sirrah, I&rsquo;ll give thee
anything but a night&rsquo;s lodging.</p>

<p>HEART.&nbsp; Whither?&nbsp; Whither?&nbsp; Which
corner-house.</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; Why, there: the two white posts.</p>
<p>HEART.&nbsp; And who would you visit there, say you?&nbsp;
(O&rsquo;ons, how my heart aches.)</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; Pshaw, thou&rsquo;rt so troublesome and
inquisitive.&nbsp; My, I&rsquo;ll tell you; &rsquo;tis a young
creature that Vainlove debauched and has forsaken.&nbsp; Did you
never hear Bellmour chide him about Sylvia?</p>
<p>HEART.&nbsp; Death, and hell, and marriage!&nbsp; My
wife!&nbsp; [<i>Aside</i>.]</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; Why, thou art as musty as a new-married man that
had found his wife knowing the first night.</p>
<p>HEART.&nbsp; Hell, and the Devil!&nbsp; Does he know it?&nbsp;
But, hold; if he should not, I were a fool to discover it.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll dissemble, and try him.&nbsp; [<i>Aside</i>.]&nbsp;
Ha, ha, ha.&nbsp; Why, Tom, is that such an occasion of
melancholy?&nbsp; Is it such an uncommon mischief?</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; No, faith; I believe not.&nbsp; Few women but
have their year of probation before they are cloistered in the
narrow joys of wedlock.&nbsp; But, prithee, come along with me or
I&rsquo;ll go and have the lady to myself.&nbsp;
B&rsquo;w&rsquo;y George.&nbsp; [<i>Going</i>.]</p>
<p>HEART.&nbsp; O torture!&nbsp; How he racks and tears me!&nbsp;
Death!&nbsp; Shall I own my shame or wittingly let him go and
whore my wife?&nbsp; No, that&rsquo;s insupportable.&nbsp; O
Sharper!</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; How now?</p>
<p>HEART.&nbsp; Oh, I am married.</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; (Now hold, spleen.)&nbsp; Married!</p>
<p>HEART.&nbsp; Certainly, irrecoverably married.</p>

<p>HEART.&nbsp; Oh, an age, an age!&nbsp; I have been married
these two hours.</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; My old bachelor married!&nbsp; That were a

<p>HEART.&nbsp; Death!&nbsp; D&rsquo;ye mock me?&nbsp; Hark ye,
if either you esteem my friendship, or your own safety&mdash;come
not near that house&mdash;that corner-house&mdash;that hot
brothel.&nbsp; Ask no questions.</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; Mad, by this light.</p>
<p>Thus grief still treads upon the heels of pleasure:<br />
Married in haste, we may repent at leisure.</p>
<h4>SCENE IX.</h4>
<p><span class="smcap">Sharper</span>, <span

<p>SET.&nbsp; Some by experience find these words misplaced:<br
/>
At leisure married, they repent in haste.</p>
<p>As I suppose my master Heartwell.</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; Here again, my Mercury!</p>
<p>SET.&nbsp; Sublimate, if you please, sir: I think my
achievements do deserve the epithet&mdash;Mercury was a pimp too,
but, though I blush to own it, at this time, I must confess I am
somewhat fallen from the dignity of my function, and do
condescend to be scandalously employed in the promotion of vulgar
matrimony.</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; As how, dear, dexterous pimp?</p>
<p>SET.&nbsp; Why, to be brief, for I have weighty affairs
depending&mdash;our stratagem succeeded as you
intended&mdash;Bluffe turns errant traitor; bribes me to make a
private conveyance of the lady to him, and put a shame-settlement
upon Sir Joseph.</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; O rogue!&nbsp; Well, but I hope&mdash;</p>
<p>SET.&nbsp; No, no; never fear me, sir.&nbsp; I privately
informed the knight of the treachery, who has agreed seemingly to
be cheated, that the captain may be so in reality.</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; Where&rsquo;s the bride?</p>
<p>SET.&nbsp; Shifting clothes for the purpose, at a
friend&rsquo;s house of mine.&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s company coming;
if you&rsquo;ll walk this way, sir, I&rsquo;ll tell you.</p>

<p>VAIN.&nbsp; Oh, &rsquo;twas frenzy all: cannot you forgive
it?&nbsp; Men in madness have a title to your pity.&nbsp;
[<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Araminta</span>.]</p>
<p>ARAM.&nbsp; Which they forfeit, when they are restored to
their senses.</p>
<p>VAIN.&nbsp; I am not presuming beyond a pardon.</p>
<p>ARAM.&nbsp; You who could reproach me with one counterfeit,
how insolent would a real pardon make you!&nbsp; But
there&rsquo;s no need to forgive what is not worth my anger.</p>
<p>BELIN.&nbsp; O&rsquo; my conscience, I could find in my heart
to marry thee, purely to be rid of thee&mdash;at least thou art
so troublesome a lover, there&rsquo;s hopes thou&rsquo;lt make a
more than ordinary quiet husband.&nbsp; [<i>To</i> <span
class="smcap">Bellmour</span>.]</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; Say you so?&nbsp; Is that a maxim among ye?</p>
<p>BELIN.&nbsp; Yes: you fluttering men of the <i>mode</i> have
made marriage a mere French dish.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; I hope there&rsquo;s no French sauce.&nbsp;
[<i>Aside</i>.]</p>
<p>BELIN.&nbsp; You are so curious in the preparation, that is,
your courtship, one would think you meant a noble
entertainment&mdash;but when we come to feed, &rsquo;tis all
froth, and poor, but in show.&nbsp; Nay, often, only remains,
which have been I know not how many times warmed for other
company, and at last served up cold to the wife.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; That were a miserable wretch indeed, who could not
afford one warm dish for the wife of his bosom.&nbsp; But you
timorous virgins form a dreadful chim&aelig;ra of a husband, as
of a creature contrary to that soft, humble, pliant, easy thing,
a lover; so guess at plagues in matrimony, in opposition to the
pleasures of courtship.&nbsp; Alas! courtship to marriage, is but
as the music in the play-house, until the curtain&rsquo;s drawn;
but that once up, then opens the scene of pleasure.</p>
<p>BELIN.&nbsp; Oh, foh,&mdash;no: rather courtship to marriage,
as a very witty prologue to a very dull play.</p>
<h4>SCENE XI.</h4>

<p>SHARP.&nbsp; Hist!&nbsp; Bellmour.&nbsp; If you&rsquo;ll bring
the ladies, make haste to Sylvia&rsquo;s lodgings, before
Heartwell has fretted himself out of breath.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; You have an opportunity now, madam, to revenge
yourself upon Heartwell, for affronting your squirrel.&nbsp;
[<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Belinda</span>.]</p>
<p>BELIN.&nbsp; Oh, the filthy rude beast.</p>
<p>ARAM.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis a lasting quarrel; I think he has never
been at our house since.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; But give yourselves the trouble to walk to that
corner-house, and I&rsquo;ll tell you by the way what may divert
and surprise you.</p>

out&mdash;Setter, I think they called him.</p>
<p>HEART.&nbsp; So-h&mdash;that precious pimp too&mdash;damned,
damned strumpet! could she not contain herself on her
wedding-day? not hold out till night?&nbsp; Oh, cursed state! how
wide we err, when apprehensive of the load of life.</p>

<p>BELIN.&nbsp; Joy, joy, Mr. Bridegroom; I give you joy,

<p>HEART.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis not in thy nature to give me
joy.&nbsp; A woman can as soon give immortality.</p>
<p>BELIN.&nbsp; Ha, ha, ha! oh Gad, men grow such clowns when
they are married.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; That they are fit for no company but their
wives.</p>
<p>BELIN.&nbsp; Nor for them neither, in a little time.&nbsp; I
swear, at the month&rsquo;s end, you shall hardly find a married
man that will do a civil thing to his wife, or say a civil thing
to anybody else.&nbsp; How he looks already, ha, ha, ha.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; Ha, ha, ha!</p>
<p>HEART.&nbsp; Death, am I made your laughing-stock?&nbsp; For
you, sir, I shall find a time; but take off your wasp here, or
the clown may grow boisterous; I have a fly-flap.</p>
<p>BELIN.&nbsp; You have occasion for&rsquo;t, your wife has been
blown upon.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s home.</p>
<p>HEART.&nbsp; Not fiends or furies could have added to my
vexation, or anything, but another woman.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve
racked my patience; begone, or by&mdash;</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; Hold, hold.&nbsp; What the devil&mdash;thou wilt
not draw upon a woman?</p>
<p>VAIN.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s the matter?</p>
<p>ARAM.&nbsp; Bless me! what have you done to him?</p>
<p>BELIN.&nbsp; Only touched a galled beast until he winced.</p>
<p>VAIN.&nbsp; Bellmour, give it over; you vex him too
much.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis all serious to him.</p>
<p>BELIN.&nbsp; Nay, I swear, I begin to pity him myself.</p>
<p>HEART.&nbsp; Damn your pity!&mdash;but let me be calm a
little.&nbsp; How have I deserved this of you? any of ye?&nbsp;
Sir, have I impaired the honour of your house, promised your
sister marriage, and whored her?&nbsp; Wherein have I injured
you?&nbsp; Did I bring a physician to your father when he lay
expiring, and endeavour to prolong his life, and you one and
twenty?&nbsp; Madam, have I had an opportunity with you and
baulked it?&nbsp; Did you ever offer me the favour that I refused
it?&nbsp; Or&mdash;</p>
<p>BELIN.&nbsp; Oh foh! what does the filthy fellow mean?&nbsp;
Lord, let me be gone.</p>
<p>ARAM.&nbsp; Hang me, if I pity you; you are right enough
served.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; This is a little scurrilous though.</p>
<p>VAIN.&nbsp; Nay, &rsquo;tis a sore of your own

<p>HEART.&nbsp; You are the principal cause of all my present
ills.&nbsp; If Sylvia had not been your mistress, my wife might
have been honest.</p>

might have been just.&nbsp; There, we are even.&nbsp; But have a
good heart, I heard of your misfortune, and come to your
relief.</p>

<p>SYLV.&nbsp; The worst of me is, that I am your wife&mdash;</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; Come, Sir Joseph, your fortune is not so bad as
you fear.&nbsp; A fine lady, and a lady of very good quality.</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; Thanks to my knighthood, she&rsquo;s a
lady&mdash;</p>
<p>VAIN.&nbsp; That deserves a fool with a better title.&nbsp;
Pray use her as my relation, or you shall hear on&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>BLUFF.&nbsp; What, are you a woman of quality too, spouse?</p>
<p>SET.&nbsp; And my relation; pray let her be respected

seven years.</p>
<p>LUCY.&nbsp; Hold your prating.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m thinking what
vocation I shall follow while my spouse is planting laurels in
the wars.</p>
<p>BLUFF.&nbsp; No more wars, spouse, no more wars.&nbsp; While I
plant laurels for my head abroad, I may find the branches sprout
at home.</p>
<p>HEART.&nbsp; Bellmour, I approve thy mirth, and thank
thee.&nbsp; And I cannot in gratitude (for I see which way thou
art going) see thee fall into the same snare out of which thou
hast delivered me.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; I thank thee, George, for thy good intention; but
there is a fatality in marriage, for I find I&rsquo;m
resolute.</p>
<p>HEART.&nbsp; Then good counsel will be thrown away upon
you.&nbsp; For my part, I have once escaped; and when I wed
again, may she be&mdash;ugly, as an old bawd.</p>

Come take your fellow-travellers.&nbsp; Old George, I&rsquo;m
sorry to see thee still plod on alone.</p>
<p>HEART.&nbsp; With gaudy plumes and jingling bells made
proud,<br />
The youthful beast sets forth, and neighs aloud.<br />
A morning-sun his tinselled harness gilds,<br />
And the first stage a down-hill greensward yields.<br />
But, oh&mdash;<br />
What rugged ways attend the noon of life!<br />
Our sun declines, and with what anxious strife,<br />
What pain we tug that galling load, a wife.<br />
All coursers the first heat with vigour run;<br />
But &rsquo;tis with whip and spur the race is won.</p>

Soon as her curiosity is over,<br />
Would give the world she could her toy recover,<br />
So fares it with our poet; and I&rsquo;m sent<br />
To tell you he already does repent:<br />
Would you were all as forward to keep Lent.<br />
Now the deed&rsquo;s done, the giddy thing has leisure<br />
To think o&rsquo; th&rsquo; sting, that&rsquo;s in the tail of
pleasure.<br />
Methinks I hear him in consideration:<br />
What will the world say?&nbsp; Where&rsquo;s my reputation?<br />
Now that&rsquo;s at stake.&nbsp; No, fool, &rsquo;tis out
o&rsquo; fashion.<br />
If loss of that should follow want of wit,<br />
How many undone men were in the pit!<br />
Why that&rsquo;s some comfort to an author&rsquo;s fears,<br />
If he&rsquo;s an ass, he will be tryed by&rsquo;s peers.<br />
But hold, I am exceeding my commission:<br />
My business here was humbly to petition;<br />
But we&rsquo;re so used to rail on these occasions,<br />
I could not help one trial of your patience:<br />
For &rsquo;tis our way, you know, for fear o&rsquo; th&rsquo;
worst,<br />
To be beforehand still, and cry Fool first.<br />
How say you, sparks?&nbsp; How do you stand affected?<br />
I swear, young Bays within is so dejected,<br />
&rsquo;Twould grieve your hearts to see him; shall I call him?<br
/>
But then you cruel critics would so maul him!<br />
Yet may be you&rsquo;ll encourage a beginner;<br />
But how?&nbsp; Just as the devil does a sinner.<br />
Women and wits are used e&rsquo;en much at one,<br />
You gain your end, and damn &rsquo;em when you&rsquo;ve done.</p>

<h3>TO THE<br />
RIGHT HONOURABLE CHARLES MONTAGUE,<br />
ONE OF THE LORDS OF THE TREASURY.</h3>
<p>Sir,&mdash;I heartily wish this play were as perfect as I
intended it, that it might be more worthy your acceptance, and
that my dedication of it to you might be more becoming that
honour and esteem which I, with everybody who is so fortunate as
to know you, have for you.&nbsp; It had your countenance when yet
unknown; and now it is made public, it wants your protection.</p>
<p>I would not have anybody imagine that I think this play
without its faults, for I am conscious of several.&nbsp; I
confess I designed (whatever vanity or ambition occasioned that
design) to have written a true and regular comedy, but I found it
an undertaking which put me in mind of <i>Sudet multum</i>,
<i>frustraque laboret ausus idem</i>.&nbsp; And now, to make
amends for the vanity of such a design, I do confess both the
attempt and the imperfect performance.&nbsp; Yet I must take the
boldness to say I have not miscarried in the whole, for the
mechanical part of it is regular.&nbsp; That I may say with as
little vanity as a builder may say he has built a house according
to the model laid down before him, or a gardener that he has set
his flowers in a knot of such or such a figure.&nbsp; I designed
the moral first, and to that moral I invented the fable, and do
not know that I have borrowed one hint of it anywhere.&nbsp; I
made the plot as strong as I could because it was single, and I
made it single because I would avoid confusion, and was resolved
to preserve the three unities of the drama.&nbsp; Sir, this
discourse is very impertinent to you, whose judgment much better
can discern the faults than I can excuse them; and whose good
nature, like that of a lover, will find out those hidden beauties
(if there are any such) which it would be great immodesty for me
to discover.&nbsp; I think I don&rsquo;t speak improperly when I
call you a <i>lover</i> of poetry; for it is very well known she
has been a very kind mistress to you: she has not denied you the
last favour, and she has been fruitful to you in a most beautiful
issue.&nbsp; If I break off abruptly here, I hope everybody will
understand that it is to avoid a commendation which, as it is
your due, would be most easy for me to pay, and too troublesome
for you to receive.</p>
<p>I have since the acting of this play harkened after the
objections which have been made to it, for I was conscious where
a true critic might have put me upon my defence.&nbsp; I was
prepared for the attack, and am pretty confident I could have
vindicated some parts and excused others; and where there were
any plain miscarriages, I would most ingenuously have confessed
&rsquo;em.&nbsp; But I have not heard anything said sufficient to
provoke an answer.&nbsp; That which looks most like an objection
does not relate in particular to this play, but to all or most
that ever have been written, and that is soliloquy.&nbsp;
Therefore I will answer it, not only for my own sake, but to save
others the trouble, to whom it may hereafter be objected.</p>
<p>I grant that for a man to talk to himself appears absurd and
unnatural, and indeed it is so in most cases; but the
circumstances which may attend the occasion make great
alteration.&nbsp; It oftentimes happens to a man to have designs
which require him to himself, and in their nature cannot admit of
a confidant.&nbsp; Such for certain is all villainy, and other
less mischievous intentions may be very improper to be
communicated to a second person.&nbsp; In such a case, therefore,
the audience must observe whether the person upon the stage takes
any notice of them at all or no.&nbsp; For if he supposes any one
to be by when he talks to himself, it is monstrous and ridiculous
to the last degree.&nbsp; Nay, not only in this case, but in any
part of a play, if there is expressed any knowledge of an
audience, it is insufferable.&nbsp; But otherwise, when a man in
soliloquy reasons with himself, and <i>pro&rsquo;s</i> and
<i>con&rsquo;s</i>, and weighs all his designs, we ought not to
imagine that this man either talks to us or to himself; he is
only thinking, and thinking such matter as were inexcusable folly
in him to speak.&nbsp; But because we are concealed spectators of
the plot in agitation, and the poet finds it necessary to let us
know the whole mystery of his contrivance, he is willing to
inform us of this person&rsquo;s thoughts; and to that end is
forced to make use of the expedient of speech, no other better
way being yet invented for the communication of thought.</p>
<p>Another very wrong objection has been made by some who have
not taken leisure to distinguish the characters.&nbsp; The hero
of the play, as they are pleased to call him (meaning Mellefont),
is a gull, and made a fool, and cheated.&nbsp; Is every man a
gull and a fool that is deceived?&nbsp; At that rate I&rsquo;m
afraid the two classes of men will be reduced to one, and the
knaves themselves be at a loss to justify their title.&nbsp; But
if an open-hearted honest man, who has an entire confidence in
one whom he takes to be his friend, and whom he has obliged to be
so, and who, to confirm him in his opinion, in all appearance and
upon several trials has been so: if this man be deceived by the
treachery of the other, must he of necessity commence fool
immediately, only because the other has proved a villain?&nbsp;
Ay, but there was caution given to Mellefont in the first act by
his friend Careless.&nbsp; Of what nature was that caution?&nbsp;
Only to give the audience some light into the character of
Maskwell before his appearance, and not to convince Mellefont of
his treachery; for that was more than Careless was then able to
do: he never knew Maskwell guilty of any villainy; he was only a
sort of man which he did not like.&nbsp; As for his suspecting
his familiarity with my Lady Touchwood, let &rsquo;em examine the
answer that Mellefont makes him, and compare it with the conduct
of Maskwell&rsquo;s character through the play.</p>
<p>I would beg &rsquo;em again to look into the character of
Maskwell before they accuse Mellefont of weakness for being
deceived by him.&nbsp; For upon summing up the enquiry into this
objection, it may be found they have mistaken cunning in one
character for folly in another.</p>
<p>But there is one thing at which I am more concerned than all
the false criticisms that are made upon me, and that is, some of
the ladies are offended.&nbsp; I am heartily sorry for it, for I
declare I would rather disoblige all the critics in the world
than one of the fair sex.&nbsp; They are concerned that I have
represented some women vicious and affected.&nbsp; How can I help
it?&nbsp; It is the business of a comic poet to paint the vices
and follies of humankind; and there are but two sexes, male and
female, <i>men</i> and <i>women</i>, which have a title to
humanity, and if I leave one half of them out, the work will be
imperfect.&nbsp; I should be very glad of an opportunity to make
my compliment to those ladies who are offended; but they can no
more expect it in a comedy than to be tickled by a surgeon when
he&rsquo;s letting &rsquo;em blood.&nbsp; They who are virtuous
or discreet should not be offended, for such characters as these
distinguish <i>them</i>, and make their beauties more shining and
observed; and they who are of the other kind may nevertheless
pass for such, by seeming not to be displeased or touched with
the satire of this <i>comedy</i>.&nbsp; Thus have they also
wrongfully accused me of doing them a prejudice, when I have in
reality done them a service.</p>
<p>You will pardon me, sir, for the freedom I take of making
answers to other people in an epistle which ought wholly to be
sacred to you; but since I intend the play to be so too, I hope I
may take the more liberty of justifying it where it is in the
right.</p>
<p>I must now, sir, declare to the world how kind you have been
to my endeavours; for in regard of what was well meant, you have
excused what was ill performed.&nbsp; I beg you would continue
the same method in your acceptance of this dedication.&nbsp; I
know no other way of making a return to that humanity you shewed,
in protecting an infant, but by enrolling it in your service, now
that it is of age and come into the world.&nbsp; Therefore be
pleased to accept of this as an acknowledgment of the favour you
have shewn me, and an earnest of the real service and gratitude
of,</p>
<p>Sir, your most obliged, humble servant,</p>

<h3>TO MY DEAR FRIEND MR. CONGREVE,<br />
ON HIS COMEDY CALLED<br />
THE DOUBLE-DEALER.</h3>
<p>Well then, the promised hour is come at last;<br />
The present age of wit obscures the past.<br />
Strong were our sires; and as they fought they writ,<br />
Conqu&rsquo;ring with force of arms and dint of wit.<br />
Theirs was the giant race, before the flood;<br />
And thus, when Charles returned, our empire stood.<br />
Like Janus he the stubborn soil manured,<br />
With rules of husbandry the rankness cured,<br />
Tamed us to manners, when the stage was rude,<br />
And boist&rsquo;rous English wit with art indued.<br />
Our age was cultivated thus at length;<br />
But what we gained in skill we lost in strength.<br />
Our builders were with want of genius curst;<br />
The second temple was not like the first:<br />
Till you, the best Vitruvius, come at length,<br />
Our beauties equal, but excel our strength.<br />
Firm Doric pillars found your solid base,<br />
The fair Corinthian crowns the higher space;<br />
Thus all below is strength, and all above is grace.<br />
In easy dialogue is Fletcher&rsquo;s praise:<br />
He moved the mind, but had no power to raise.<br />
Great Johnson did by strength of judgment please<br />
Yet doubling Fletcher&rsquo;s force, he wants ease.<br />
In diff&rsquo;ring talents both adorned their age;<br />
One for the study, t&rsquo;other for the stage.<br />
But both to Congreve justly shall submit,<br />
One matched in judgment, both o&rsquo;er-matched in wit.<br />
In him all beauties of this age we see,<br />
Etherege his courtship, Southern&rsquo;s purity,<br />
The satire, wit, and strength of manly Wycherly.<br />
All this in blooming youth you have achieved,<br />
Nor are your foiled contemporaries grieved;<br />
So much the sweetness of your manners move,<br />
We cannot envy you, because we love.<br />
Fabius might joy in Scipio, when he saw<br />
A beardless consul made against the law,<br />
And join his suffrage to the votes of Rome;<br />
Though he with Hannibal was overcome.<br />
Thus old Romano bowed to Raphael&rsquo;s fame,<br />
And scholar to the youth he taught became.</p>
<p>O that your brows my laurel had sustained,<br />
Well had I been deposed if you had reigned!<br />
The father had descended for the son,<br />
For only you are lineal to the throne.<br />
Thus when the state one Edward did depose,<br />
A greater Edward in his room arose.<br />
But now, not I, but poetry is cursed;<br />
For Tom the Second reigns like Tom the First.<br />
But let &rsquo;em not mistake my patron&rsquo;s part,<br />
Nor call his charity their own desert.<br />
Yet this I prophesy: Thou shalt be seen<br />
(Though with some short parenthesis between)<br />
High on the throne of wit; and seated there,<br />
Not mine (that&rsquo;s little) but thy laurel wear.<br />
Thy first attempt an early promise made;<br />
That early promise this has more than paid.<br />
So bold, yet so judiciously you dare,<br />
That your least praise is to be regular.<br />
Time, place, and action may with pains be wrought,<br />
But genius must be born, and never can be taught.<br />
This is your portion, this your native store,<br />
Heav&rsquo;n, that but once was prodigal before,<br />
To Shakespeare gave as much; she could not give him more.</p>
<p>Maintain your post: that&rsquo;s all the fame you need;<br />
For &rsquo;tis impossible you should proceed.<br />
Already I am worn with cares and age,<br />
And just abandoning th&rsquo; ungrateful stage:<br />
Unprofitably kept at heav&rsquo;n&rsquo;s expense,<br />
I live a rent-charge on his providence.<br />
But you, whom every muse and grace adorn,<br />
Whom I foresee to better fortune born,<br />
Be kind to my remains; and oh, defend,<br />
Against your judgment, your departed friend!<br />
Let not th&rsquo; insulting foe my fame pursue;<br />
But shade those laurels which descend to you:<br />
And take for tribute what these lines express:<br />
You merit more; nor could my love do less.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">JOHN DRYDEN.</p>
<h3>PROLOGUE<br />
Spoken by <span class="smcap">Mrs. Bracegirdle</span>.</h3>
<p>Moors have this way (as story tells) to know<br />
Whether their brats are truly got or no;<br />
Into the sea the new-born babe is thrown,<br />
There, as instinct directs, to swim or drown.<br />
A barbarous device, to try if spouse<br />
Has kept religiously her nuptial vows.</p>
<p>Such are the trials poets make of plays,<br />
Only they trust to more inconstant seas;<br />
So does our author, this his child commit<br />
To the tempestuous mercy of the pit,<br />
To know if it be truly born of wit.</p>
<p>Critics avaunt, for you are fish of prey,<br />
And feed, like sharks, upon an infant play.<br />
Be ev&rsquo;ry monster of the deep away;<br />
Let&rsquo;s have a fair trial and a clear sea.</p>
<p>Let nature work, and do not damn too soon,<br />
For life will struggle long e&rsquo;er it sink down:<br />
And will at least rise thrice before it drown.<br />
Let us consider, had it been our fate,<br />
Thus hardly to be proved legitimate:<br />
I will not say, we&rsquo;d all in danger been,<br />
Were each to suffer for his mother&rsquo;s sin:<br />
But by my troth I cannot avoid thinking,<br />
How nearly some good men might have &rsquo;scaped sinking.<br />
But, heav&rsquo;n be praised, this custom is confined<br />
Alone to th&rsquo; offspring of the muses kind:<br />
Our Christian cuckolds are more bent to pity;<br />
I know not one Moor-husband in the city.<br />
I&rsquo; th&rsquo; good man&rsquo;s arms the chopping bastard
thrives,<br />
For he thinks all his own that is his wives&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Whatever fate is for this play designed,<br />
The poet&rsquo;s sure he shall some comfort find:<br />
For if his muse has played him false, the worst<br />
That can befall him, is, to be divorced:<br />
You husbands judge, if that be to be cursed.</p>

<h4>SCENE I.</h4>
<p><i>A gallery in the Lord Touchwood&rsquo;s home</i>, <i>with
chambers adjoining</i>.</p>
<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Careless</span>, <i>crossing
the stage</i>, <i>with his hat</i>, <i>gloves</i>, <i>and sword
in his hands</i>; <i>as just risen from table</i>: <span
class="smcap">Mellefont</span> <i>following him</i>.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; Ned, Ned, whither so fast?&nbsp; What, turned
flincher!&nbsp; Why, you wo&rsquo; not leave us?</p>
<p>CARE.&nbsp; Where are the women?&nbsp; I&rsquo;m weary of
guzzling, and begin to think them the better company.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; Then thy reason staggers, and thou&rsquo;rt almost
drunk.</p>
<p>CARE.&nbsp; No, faith, but your fools grow noisy; and if a man
must endure the noise of words without sense, I think the women
have more musical voices, and become nonsense better.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; Why, they are at the end of the gallery; retired to
their tea and scandal, according to their ancient custom, after
dinner.&nbsp; But I made a pretence to follow you, because I had
something to say to you in private, and I am not like to have
many opportunities this evening.</p>
<p>CARE.&nbsp; And here&rsquo;s this coxcomb most critically come
to interrupt you.</p>
<h4>SCENE II.</h4>
<p>[<i>To them</i>] <span class="smcap">Brisk</span>.</p>
<p>BRISK.&nbsp; Boys, boys, lads, where are you?&nbsp; What, do
you give ground?&nbsp; Mortgage for a bottle, ha?&nbsp; Careless,
this is your trick; you&rsquo;re always spoiling company by
leaving it.</p>
<p>CARE.&nbsp; And thou art always spoiling company by coming in
o&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>BRISK.&nbsp; Pooh, ha, ha, ha, I know you envy me.&nbsp;
Spite, proud spite, by the gods! and burning envy.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll be judged by Mellefont here, who gives and takes
raillery better than you or I.&nbsp; Pshaw, man, when I say you
spoil company by leaving it, I mean you leave nobody for the
company to laugh at.&nbsp; I think there I was with you.&nbsp;
Ha, Mellefont?</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; O&rsquo; my word, Brisk, that was a home thrust;
you have silenced him.</p>
<p>BRISK.&nbsp; Oh, my dear Mellefont, let me perish if thou art
not the soul of conversation, the very essence of wit and spirit
of wine.&nbsp; The deuce take me if there were three good things
said, or one understood, since thy amputation from the body of
our society.&nbsp; He, I think that&rsquo;s pretty and
metaphorical enough; i&rsquo;gad I could not have said it out of
thy company.&nbsp; Careless, ha?</p>
<p>CARE.&nbsp; Hum, ay, what is&rsquo;t?</p>
<p>BRISK.&nbsp; <i>O mon c&oelig;ur</i>!&nbsp; What
is&rsquo;t!&nbsp; Nay, gad, I&rsquo;ll punish you for want of
apprehension.&nbsp; The deuce take me if I tell you.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; No, no, hang him, he has no taste.&nbsp; But, dear
Brisk, excuse me, I have a little business.</p>
<p>CARE.&nbsp; Prithee get thee gone; thou seest we are
serious.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll come immediately, if you&rsquo;ll but
go in and keep up good humour and sense in the company.&nbsp;
Prithee do, they&rsquo;ll fall asleep else.</p>
<p>BRISK.&nbsp; I&rsquo;gad, so they will.&nbsp; Well, I will, I
will; gad, you shall command me from the Zenith to the
Nadir.&nbsp; But the deuce take me if I say a good thing till you
come.&nbsp; But prithee, dear rogue, make haste, prithee make
haste, I shall burst else.&nbsp; And yonder your uncle, my Lord
Touchwood, swears he&rsquo;ll disinherit you, and Sir Paul Plyant
threatens to disclaim you for a son-in-law, and my Lord Froth
won&rsquo;t dance at your wedding to-morrow; nor, the deuce take
me, I won&rsquo;t write your Epithalamium&mdash;and see what a
condition you&rsquo;re like to be brought to.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; Well, I&rsquo;ll speak but three words, and follow
you.</p>
<p>BRISK.&nbsp; Enough, enough.&nbsp; Careless, bring your
apprehension along with you.</p>
<h4>SCENE III.</h4>
<p><span class="smcap">Mellefont</span>, <span
class="smcap">Careless</span>.</p>
<p>CARE.&nbsp; Pert coxcomb.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; Faith, &rsquo;tis a good-natured coxcomb, and has
very entertaining follies.&nbsp; You must be more humane to him;
at this juncture it will do me service.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll tell
you, I would have mirth continued this day at any rate; though
patience purchase folly, and attention be paid with noise, there
are times when sense may be unseasonable as well as truth.&nbsp;
Prithee do thou wear none to-day, but allow Brisk to have wit,
that thou may&rsquo;st seem a fool.</p>
<p>CARE.&nbsp; Why, how now, why this extravagant
proposition?</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; Oh, I would have no room for serious design, for I
am jealous of a plot.&nbsp; I would have noise and impertinence
keep my Lady Touchwood&rsquo;s head from working: for hell is not
more busy than her brain, nor contains more devils than that
imaginations.</p>
<p>CARE.&nbsp; I thought your fear of her had been over.&nbsp; Is
not to-morrow appointed for your marriage with Cynthia, and her
father, Sir Paul Plyant, come to settle the writings this day on
purpose?</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; True; but you shall judge whether I have not reason
to be alarmed.&nbsp; None besides you and Maskwell are acquainted
with the secret of my Aunt Touchwood&rsquo;s violent passion for
me.&nbsp; Since my first refusal of her addresses she has
endeavoured to do me all ill offices with my uncle, yet has
managed &rsquo;em with that subtilty, that to him they have borne
the face of kindness; while her malice, like a dark lanthorn,
only shone upon me where it was directed.&nbsp; Still, it gave me
less perplexity to prevent the success of her displeasure than to
avoid the importunities of her love, and of two evils I thought
myself favoured in her aversion.&nbsp; But whether urged by her
despair and the short prospect of time she saw to accomplish her
designs; whether the hopes of revenge, or of her love, terminated
in the view of this my marriage with Cynthia, I know not, but
this morning she surprised me in my bed.</p>
<p>CARE.&nbsp; Was there ever such a fury!&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis well
nature has not put it into her sex&rsquo;s power to ravish.&nbsp;
Well, bless us, proceed.&nbsp; What followed?</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; What at first amazed me&mdash;for I looked to have
seen her in all the transports of a slighted and revengeful
woman&mdash;but when I expected thunder from her voice, and
lightning in her eyes, I saw her melted into tears and hushed
into a sigh.&nbsp; It was long before either of us spoke: passion
had tied her tongue, and amazement mine.&nbsp; In short, the
consequence was thus, she omitted nothing that the most violent
love could urge, or tender words express; which when she saw had
no effect, but still I pleaded honour and nearness of blood to my
uncle, then came the storm I feared at first, for, starting from
my bed-side like a fury, she flew to my sword, and with much ado
I prevented her doing me or herself a mischief.&nbsp; Having
disarmed her, in a gust of passion she left me, and in a
resolution, confirmed by a thousand curses, not to close her eyes
till they had seen my ruin.</p>
<p>CARE.&nbsp; Exquisite woman!&nbsp; But what the devil, does
she think thou hast no more sense than to get an heir upon her
body to disinherit thyself? for as I take it this settlement upon
you is, with a proviso, that your uncle have no children.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; It is so.&nbsp; Well, the service you are to do me
will be a pleasure to yourself: I must get you to engage my Lady
Plyant all this evening, that my pious aunt may not work her to
her interest.&nbsp; And if you chance to secure her to yourself,
you may incline her to mine.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s handsome, and
knows it; is very silly, and thinks she has sense, and has an old
fond husband.</p>
<p>CARE.&nbsp; I confess, a very fair foundation for a lover to
build upon.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; For my Lord Froth, he and his wife will be
sufficiently taken up with admiring one another and Brisk&rsquo;s
gallantry, as they call it.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll observe my uncle
myself, and Jack Maskwell has promised me to watch my aunt
narrowly, and give me notice upon any suspicion.&nbsp; As for Sir
Paul, my wise father-in-law that is to be, my dear Cynthia has
such a share in his fatherly fondness, he would scarce make her a
moment uneasy to have her happy hereafter.</p>
<p>CARE.&nbsp; So you have manned your works; but I wish you may
not have the weakest guard where the enemy is strongest.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; Maskwell, you mean; prithee why should you suspect
him?</p>
<p>CARE.&nbsp; Faith I cannot help it; you know I never liked
him: I am a little superstitious in physiognomy.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; He has obligations of gratitude to bind him to me:
his dependence upon my uncle is through my means.</p>
<p>CARE.&nbsp; Upon your aunt, you mean.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; My aunt!</p>
<p>CARE.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m mistaken if there be not a familiarity
between them you do not suspect, notwithstanding her passion for
you.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; Pooh, pooh! nothing in the world but his design to
do me service; and he endeavours to be well in her esteem, that
he may be able to effect it.</p>
<p>CARE.&nbsp; Well, I shall be glad to be mistaken; but your
aunt&rsquo;s aversion in her revenge cannot be any way so
effectually shown as in bringing forth a child to disinherit
you.&nbsp; She is handsome and cunning and naturally
wanton.&nbsp; Maskwell is flesh and blood at best, and
opportunities between them are frequent.&nbsp; His affection to
you, you have confessed, is grounded upon his interest, that you
have transplanted; and should it take root in my lady, I
don&rsquo;t see what you can expect from the fruit.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; I confess the consequence is visible, were your
suspicions just.&nbsp; But see, the company is broke up,
let&rsquo;s meet &rsquo;em.</p>
<h4>SCENE IV.</h4>
<p>[<i>To them</i>] <span class="smcap">Lord Touchwood</span>,
<span class="smcap">Lord Froth</span>, <span class="smcap">Sir
Paul Plyant</span>, <i>and</i> <span
class="smcap">Brisk</span>.</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; Out upon&rsquo;t, nephew.&nbsp; Leave your
father-in-law and me to maintain our ground against young
people!</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; I beg your lordship&rsquo;s pardon.&nbsp; We were
just returning.</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; Were you, son?&nbsp; Gadsbud, much better as
it is.&nbsp; Good, strange!&nbsp; I swear I&rsquo;m almost tipsy;
t&rsquo;other bottle would have been too powerful for
me,&mdash;as sure as can be it would.&nbsp; We wanted your
company, but Mr. Brisk&mdash;where is he?&nbsp; I swear and vow
he&rsquo;s a most facetious person, and the best company.&nbsp;
And, my Lord Froth, your lordship is so merry a man, he, he,
he.</p>
<p>LORD FROTH.&nbsp; Oh, foy, Sir Paul, what do you mean?&nbsp;
Merry!&nbsp; Oh, barbarous!&nbsp; I&rsquo;d as lieve you called
me fool.</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; Nay, I protest and vow now, &rsquo;tis true;
when Mr. Brisk jokes, your lordship&rsquo;s laugh does so become
you, he, he, he.</p>
<p>LORD FROTH.&nbsp; Ridiculous!&nbsp; Sir Paul, you&rsquo;re
strangely mistaken, I find champagne is powerful.&nbsp; I assure
you, Sir Paul, I laugh at nobody&rsquo;s jest but my own, or a
lady&rsquo;s, I assure you, Sir Paul.</p>
<p>BRISK.&nbsp; How? how, my lord? what, affront my wit!&nbsp;
Let me perish, do I never say anything worthy to be laughed
at?</p>
<p>LORD FROTH.&nbsp; Oh, foy, don&rsquo;t misapprehend me; I
don&rsquo;t say so, for I often smile at your conceptions.&nbsp;
But there is nothing more unbecoming a man of quality than to
laugh; &rsquo;tis such a vulgar expression of the passion;
everybody can laugh.&nbsp; Then especially to laugh at the jest
of an inferior person, or when anybody else of the same quality
does not laugh with one&mdash;ridiculous!&nbsp; To be pleased
with what pleases the crowd!&nbsp; Now when I laugh, I always
laugh alone.</p>
<p>BRISK.&nbsp; I suppose that&rsquo;s because you laugh at your
own jests, i&rsquo;gad, ha, ha, ha.</p>
<p>LORD FROTH.&nbsp; He, he, I swear though, your raillery
provokes me to a smile.</p>
<p>BRISK.&nbsp; Ay, my lord, it&rsquo;s a sign I hit you in the
teeth, if you show &rsquo;em.</p>
<p>LORD FROTH.&nbsp; He, he, he, I swear that&rsquo;s so very
pretty, I can&rsquo;t forbear.</p>
<p>CARE.&nbsp; I find a quibble bears more sway in your
lordship&rsquo;s face than a jest.</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; Sir Paul, if you please we&rsquo;ll retire
to the ladies, and drink a dish of tea to settle our heads.</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; With all my heart.&nbsp; Mr. Brisk,
you&rsquo;ll come to us, or call me when you joke; I&rsquo;ll be
ready to laugh incontinently.</p>
<h4>SCENE V.</h4>
<p><span class="smcap">Mellefont</span>, <span
class="smcap">Careless</span>, <span class="smcap">Lord
Froth</span>, <span class="smcap">Brisk</span>.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; But does your lordship never see comedies?</p>
<p>LORD FROTH.&nbsp; Oh yes, sometimes; but I never laugh.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; No?</p>
<p>LORD FROTH.&nbsp; Oh no; never laugh indeed, sir.</p>
<p>CARE.&nbsp; No! why, what d&rsquo;ye go there for?</p>
<p>LORD FROTH.&nbsp; To distinguish myself from the commonalty
and mortify the poets; the fellows grow so conceited, when any of
their foolish wit prevails upon the side-boxes.&nbsp; I
swear,&mdash;he, he, he, I have often constrained my inclinations
to laugh,&mdash;he, he, he, to avoid giving them
encouragement.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; You are cruel to yourself, my lord, as well as
malicious to them.</p>
<p>LORD FROTH.&nbsp; I confess I did myself some violence at
first, but now I think I have conquered it.</p>
<p>BRISK.&nbsp; Let me perish, my lord, but there is something
very particular in the humour; &rsquo;tis true it makes against
wit, and I&rsquo;m sorry for some friends of mine that write;
but, i&rsquo;gad, I love to be malicious.&nbsp; Nay, deuce take
me, there&rsquo;s wit in&rsquo;t, too.&nbsp; And wit must be
foiled by wit; cut a diamond with a diamond, no other way,
i&rsquo;gad.</p>
<p>LORD FROTH.&nbsp; Oh, I thought you would not be long before
you found out the wit.</p>
<p>CARE.&nbsp; Wit!&nbsp; In what?&nbsp; Where the devil&rsquo;s
the wit in not laughing when a man has a mind to&rsquo;t?</p>
<p>BRISK.&nbsp; O Lord, why can&rsquo;t you find it out?&nbsp;
Why, there &rsquo;tis, in the not laughing.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you
apprehend me?&nbsp; My lord, Careless is a very honest fellow,
but harkee, you understand me, somewhat heavy, a little shallow,
or so.&nbsp; Why, I&rsquo;ll tell you now, suppose now you come
up to me&mdash;nay, prithee, Careless, be instructed.&nbsp;
Suppose, as I was saying, you come up to me holding your sides,
and laughing as if you would&mdash;well&mdash;I look grave, and
ask the cause of this immoderate mirth.&nbsp; You laugh on still,
and are not able to tell me, still I look grave, not so much as
smile.</p>
<p>CARE.&nbsp; Smile, no, what the devil should you smile at,
when you suppose I can&rsquo;t tell you!</p>
<p>BRISK.&nbsp; Pshaw, pshaw, prithee don&rsquo;t interrupt
me.&nbsp; But I tell you, you shall tell me at last, but it shall
be a great while first.</p>
<p>CARE.&nbsp; Well, but prithee don&rsquo;t let it be a great
while, because I long to have it over.</p>
<p>BRISK.&nbsp; Well then, you tell me some good jest or some
very witty thing, laughing all the while as if you were ready to
die, and I hear it, and look thus.&nbsp; Would not you be
disappointed?</p>
<p>CARE.&nbsp; No; for if it were a witty thing I should not
expect you to understand it.</p>
<p>LORD FROTH.&nbsp; Oh, foy, Mr. Careless, all the world allows
Mr. Brisk to have wit; my wife says he has a great deal.&nbsp; I
hope you think her a judge.</p>
<p>BRISK.&nbsp; Pooh, my lord, his voice goes for nothing; I
can&rsquo;t tell how to make him apprehend.&nbsp; Take it
t&rsquo;other way.&nbsp; Suppose I say a witty thing to you?</p>
<p>CARE.&nbsp; Then I shall be disappointed indeed.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; Let him alone, Brisk, he is obstinately bent not to
be instructed.</p>
<p>BRISK.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sorry for him, the deuce take me.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; Shall we go to the ladies, my lord?</p>
<p>LORD FROTH.&nbsp; With all my heart; methinks we are a
solitude without &rsquo;em.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; Or what say you to another bottle of champagne?</p>
<p>LORD FROTH.&nbsp; Oh, for the universe not a drop more, I
beseech you.&nbsp; Oh, intemperate!&nbsp; I have a flushing in my
face already.&nbsp; [<i>Takes out a pocket-glass and looks in
it</i>.]</p>
<p>BRISK.&nbsp; Let me see, let me see, my lord, I broke my glass
that was in the lid of my snuff-box.&nbsp; Hum!&nbsp; Deuce take
me, I have encouraged a pimple here too.&nbsp; [<i>Takes the
glass and looks</i>.]</p>
<p>LORD FROTH.&nbsp; Then you must mortify him with a patch; my
wife shall supply you.&nbsp; Come, gentlemen, <i>allons</i>, here
is company coming.</p>
<h4>SCENE VI.</h4>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Touchwood</span> <i>and</i> <span
class="smcap">Maskwell</span>.</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll hear no more.&nbsp; You are false
and ungrateful; come, I know you false.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; I have been frail, I confess, madam, for your
ladyship&rsquo;s service.</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; That I should trust a man whom I had known
betray his friend!</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; What friend have I betrayed? or to whom?</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; Your fond friend Mellefont, and to me; can
you deny it?</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; I do not.</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; Have you not wronged my lord, who has been a
father to you in your wants, and given you being?&nbsp; Have you
not wronged him in the highest manner, in his bed?</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; With your ladyship&rsquo;s help, and for your
service, as I told you before.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t deny that
neither.&nbsp; Anything more, madam?</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; More!&nbsp; Audacious villain!&nbsp; Oh,
what&rsquo;s more, is most my shame.&nbsp; Have you not
dishonoured me?</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; No, that I deny; for I never told in all my life:
so that accusation&rsquo;s answered; on to the next.</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; Death, do you dally with my passion?&nbsp;
Insolent devil!&nbsp; But have a care,&mdash;provoke me not; for,
by the eternal fire, you shall not &rsquo;scape my
vengeance.&nbsp; Calm villain!&nbsp; How unconcerned he stands,
confessing treachery and ingratitude!&nbsp; Is there a vice more
black?&nbsp; Oh, I have excuses thousands for my faults; fire in
my temper, passions in my soul, apt to ev&rsquo;ry provocation,
oppressed at once with love, and with despair.&nbsp; But a
sedate, a thinking villain, whose black blood runs temperately
bad, what excuse can clear?</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; Will you be in temper, madam?&nbsp; I would not
talk not to be heard.&nbsp; I have been [<i>she walks about
disordered</i>] a very great rogue for your sake, and you
reproach me with it; I am ready to be a rogue still, to do you
service; and you are flinging conscience and honour in my face,
to rebate my inclinations.&nbsp; How am I to behave myself?&nbsp;
You know I am your creature, my life and fortune in your power;
to disoblige you brings me certain ruin.&nbsp; Allow it I would
betray you, I would not be a traitor to myself: I don&rsquo;t
pretend to honesty, because you know I am a rascal; but I would
convince you from the necessity of my being firm to you.</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; Necessity, impudence!&nbsp; Can no gratitude
incline you, no obligations touch you?&nbsp; Have not my fortune
and my person been subjected to your pleasure?&nbsp; Were you not
in the nature of a servant, and have not I in effect made you
lord of all, of me, and of my lord?&nbsp; Where is that humble
love, the languishing, that adoration, which once was paid me,
and everlastingly engaged?</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; Fixt, rooted in my heart, whence nothing can
remove &rsquo;em, yet you&mdash;</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; Yet, what yet?</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; Nay, misconceive me not, madam, when I say I have
had a gen&rsquo;rous and a faithful passion, which you had never
favoured, but through revenge and policy.</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; Ha!</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; Look you, madam, we are alone,&mdash;pray contain
yourself and hear me.&nbsp; You know you loved your nephew when I
first sighed for you; I quickly found it: an argument that I
loved, for with that art you veiled your passion &rsquo;twas
imperceptible to all but jealous eyes.&nbsp; This discovery made
me bold; I confess it; for by it I thought you in my power.&nbsp;
Your nephew&rsquo;s scorn of you added to my hopes; I watched the
occasion, and took you, just repulsed by him, warm at once with
love and indignation; your disposition, my arguments, and happy
opportunity accomplished my design; I pressed the yielding
minute, and was blest.&nbsp; How I have loved you since, words
have not shown, then how should words express?</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; Well, mollifying devil!&nbsp; And have I not
met your love with forward fire?</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; Your zeal, I grant, was ardent, but misplaced;
there was revenge in view; that woman&rsquo;s idol had defiled
the temple of the god, and love was made a mock-worship.&nbsp; A
son and heir would have edged young Mellefont upon the brink of
ruin, and left him none but you to catch at for prevention.</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; Again provoke me!&nbsp; Do you wind me like
a larum, only to rouse my own stilled soul for your
diversion?&nbsp; Confusion!</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; Nay, madam, I&rsquo;m gone, if you relapse.&nbsp;
What needs this?&nbsp; I say nothing but what you yourself, in
open hours of love, have told me.&nbsp; Why should you deny
it?&nbsp; Nay, how can you?&nbsp; Is not all this present heat
owing to the same fire?&nbsp; Do you not love him still?&nbsp;
How have I this day offended you, but in not breaking off his
match with Cynthia? which, ere to-morrow, shall be done, had you
but patience.</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; How, what said you, Maskwell?&nbsp; Another
caprice to unwind my temper?</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; By heav&rsquo;n, no; I am your slave, the slave of
all your pleasures; and will not rest till I have given you
peace, would you suffer me.</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; O Maskwell! in vain I do disguise me from
thee, thou know&rsquo;st me, knowest the very inmost windings and
recesses of my soul.&nbsp; O Mellefont!&nbsp; I burn; married to
morrow!&nbsp; Despair strikes me.&nbsp; Yet my soul knows I hate
him too: let him but once be mine, and next immediate ruin seize
him.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; Compose yourself, you shall possess and ruin him
too,&mdash;will that please you?</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; How, how?&nbsp; Thou dear, thou precious
villain, how?</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; You have already been tampering with my Lady
Plyant.</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; I have: she is ready for any impression I
think fit.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; She must be throughly persuaded that Mellefont
loves her.</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; She is so credulous that way naturally, and
likes him so well, that she will believe it faster than I can
persuade her.&nbsp; But I don&rsquo;t see what you can propose
from such a trifling design, for her first conversing with
Mellefont will convince her of the contrary.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; I know it.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t depend upon
it.&nbsp; But it will prepare something else, and gain us leisure
to lay a stronger plot.&nbsp; If I gain a little time, I shall
not want contrivance.</p>
<p>One minute gives invention to destroy,</p>
<p>What to rebuild will a whole age employ.</p>
<h3>ACT II.</h3>
<h4>SCENE I.</h4>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Froth</span> <i>and</i> <span
class="smcap">Cynthia</span>.</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; Indeed, madam!&nbsp; Is it possible your ladyship
could have been so much in love?</p>
<p>LADY FROTH.&nbsp; I could not sleep; I did not sleep one wink
for three weeks together.</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; Prodigious!&nbsp; I wonder want of sleep, and so
much love and so much wit as your ladyship has, did not turn your
brain.</p>
<p>LADY FROTH.&nbsp; Oh, my dear Cynthia, you must not rally your
friend.&nbsp; But really, as you say, I wonder too.&nbsp; But
then I had a way.&nbsp; For, between you and I, I had whimsies
and vapours, but I gave them vent.</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; How, pray, madam?</p>
<p>LADY FROTH.&nbsp; Oh, I writ, writ abundantly.&nbsp; Do you
never write?</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; Write what?</p>
<p>LADY FROTH.&nbsp; Songs, elegies, satires, encomiums,
panegyrics, lampoons, plays, or heroic poems?</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; O Lord, not I, madam; I&rsquo;m content to be a
courteous reader.</p>
<p>LADY FROTH.&nbsp; Oh, inconsistent!&nbsp; In love and not
write!&nbsp; If my lord and I had been both of your temper, we
had never come together.&nbsp; Oh, bless me!&nbsp; What a sad
thing would that have been, if my lord and I should never have
met!</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; Then neither my lord nor you would ever have met
with your match, on my conscience.</p>
<p>LADY FROTH.&nbsp; O&rsquo; my conscience, no more we should;
thou say&rsquo;st right.&nbsp; For sure my Lord Froth is as fine
a gentleman and as much a man of quality!&nbsp; Ah! nothing at
all of the common air.&nbsp; I think I may say he wants nothing
but a blue ribbon and a star to make him shine, the very
phosphorus of our hemisphere.&nbsp; Do you understand those two
hard words?&nbsp; If you don&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;ll explain
&rsquo;em to you.</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; Yes, yes, madam, I&rsquo;m not so
ignorant.&mdash;At least I won&rsquo;t own it, to be troubled
with your instructions.&nbsp; [<i>Aside</i>.]</p>
<p>LADY FROTH.&nbsp; Nay, I beg your pardon; but being derived
from the Greek, I thought you might have escaped the
etymology.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;m the more amazed to find you a
woman of letters and not write!&nbsp; Bless me! how can Mellefont
believe you love him?</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; Why, faith, madam, he that won&rsquo;t take my
word shall never have it under my hand.</p>
<p>LADY FROTH.&nbsp; I vow Mellefont&rsquo;s a pretty gentleman,
but methinks he wants a manner.</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; A manner!&nbsp; What&rsquo;s that, madam?</p>
<p>LADY FROTH.&nbsp; Some distinguishing quality, as, for
example, the <i>bel air</i> or <i>brillant</i> of Mr. Brisk; the
solemnity, yet complaisance of my lord, or something of his own
that should look a little <i>Je-ne-sais-quoish</i>; he is too
much a mediocrity, in my mind.</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; He does not indeed affect either pertness or
formality; for which I like him.&nbsp; Here he comes.</p>
<p>LADY FROTH.&nbsp; And my lord with him.&nbsp; Pray observe the
difference.</p>
<h4>SCENE II.</h4>
<p>[<i>To them</i>] <span class="smcap">Lord Froth</span>, <span
class="smcap">Mellefont</span>, <i>and</i> <span
class="smcap">Brisk</span>.</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; Impertinent creature!&nbsp; I could almost be
angry with her now.&nbsp; [<i>Aside</i>.]</p>
<p>LADY FROTH.&nbsp; My lord, I have been telling Cynthia how
much I have been in love with you; I swear I have; I&rsquo;m not
ashamed to own it now.&nbsp; Ah! it makes my heart leap, I vow I
sigh when I think on&rsquo;t.&nbsp; My dear lord!&nbsp; Ha, ha,
ha, do you remember, my lord?&nbsp; [<i>Squeezes him by the
hand</i>, <i>looks kindly on him</i>, <i>sighs</i>, <i>and then
laughs out</i>.]</p>
<p>LORD FROTH.&nbsp; Pleasant creature! perfectly well, ah! that
look, ay, there it is; who could resist? &rsquo;twas so my heart
was made a captive first, and ever since t&rsquo;has been in love
with happy slavery.</p>
<p>LADY FROTH.&nbsp; Oh, that tongue, that dear deceitful tongue!
that charming softness in your mien and your expression, and then
your bow!&nbsp; Good my lord, bow as you did when I gave you my
picture; here, suppose this my picture. [<i>Gives him a
pocket-glass</i>.]&nbsp; Pray mind, my lord; ah! he bows
charmingly; nay, my lord, you shan&rsquo;t kiss it so much; I
shall grow jealous, I vow now.&nbsp; [<i>He bows profoundly
low</i>, <i>then kisses the glass</i>.]</p>
<p>LORD FROTH.&nbsp; I saw myself there, and kissed it for your
sake.</p>
<p>LADY FROTH.&nbsp; Ah!&nbsp; Gallantry to the last
degree.&nbsp; Mr. Brisk, you&rsquo;re a judge; was ever anything
so well bred as my lord?</p>
<p>BRISK.&nbsp; Never anything, but your ladyship; let me
perish.</p>
<p>LADY FROTH.&nbsp; Oh, prettily turned again; let me die, but
you have a great deal of wit.&nbsp; Mr. Mellefont, don&rsquo;t
you think Mr. Brisk has a world of wit?</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; O yes, madam.</p>
<p>BRISK.&nbsp; O dear, madam&mdash;</p>
<p>LADY FROTH.&nbsp; An infinite deal!</p>
<p>BRISK.&nbsp; O heav&rsquo;ns, madam&mdash;</p>
<p>LADY FROTH.&nbsp; More wit than anybody.</p>
<p>BRISK.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m everlastingly your humble servant,
deuce take me, madam.</p>
<p>LORD FROTH.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you think us a happy couple?</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; I vow, my lord, I think you the happiest couple in
the world, for you&rsquo;re not only happy in one another, and
when you are together, but happy in yourselves, and by
yourselves.</p>
<p>LORD FROTH.&nbsp; I hope Mellefont will make a good husband
too.</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis my interest to believe he will, my
Lord.</p>
<p>LORD FROTH.&nbsp; D&rsquo;ye think he&rsquo;ll love you as
well as I do my wife?&nbsp; I&rsquo;m afraid not.</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; I believe he&rsquo;ll love me better.</p>
<p>LORD FROTH.&nbsp; Heav&rsquo;ns! that can never be.&nbsp; But
why do you think so?</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; Because he has not so much reason to be fond of
himself.</p>
<p>LORD FROTH.&nbsp; Oh, your humble servant for that, dear
madam.&nbsp; Well, Mellefont, you&rsquo;ll be a happy
creature.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; Ay, my lord, I shall have the same reason for my
happiness that your lordship has, I shall think myself happy.</p>
<p>LORD FROTH.&nbsp; Ah, that&rsquo;s all.</p>
<p>BRISK.&nbsp; [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Lady
Froth</span>.]&nbsp; Your ladyship is in the right; but,
i&rsquo;gad, I&rsquo;m wholly turned into satire.&nbsp; I confess
I write but seldom, but when I do&mdash;keen iambics,
i&rsquo;gad.&nbsp; But my lord was telling me your ladyship has
made an essay toward an heroic poem.</p>
<p>LADY FROTH.&nbsp; Did my lord tell you?&nbsp; Yes, I vow, and
the subject is my lord&rsquo;s love to me.&nbsp; And what do you
think I call it?&nbsp; I dare swear you won&rsquo;t
guess&mdash;<i>The Sillabub</i>, ha, ha, ha.</p>
<p>BRISK.&nbsp; Because my lord&rsquo;s title&rsquo;s Froth,
i&rsquo;gad, ha, ha, ha, deuce take me, very &agrave; propos and
surprising, ha, ha, ha.</p>
<p>LADY FROTH.&nbsp; He, ay, is not it?&nbsp; And then I call my
lord Spumoso; and myself, what d&rsquo;ye think I call
myself?</p>
<p>BRISK.&nbsp; Lactilla, may be,&mdash;i&rsquo;gad, I cannot
tell.</p>
<p>LADY FROTH.&nbsp; Biddy, that&rsquo;s all; just my own
name.</p>
<p>BRISK.&nbsp; Biddy!&nbsp; I&rsquo;gad, very pretty.&nbsp;
Deuce take me if your ladyship has not the art of surprising the
most naturally in the world.&nbsp; I hope you&rsquo;ll make me
happy in communicating the poem.</p>
<p>LADY FROTH.&nbsp; Oh, you must be my confidant, I must ask
your advice.</p>
<p>BRISK.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m your humble servant, let me
perish.&nbsp; I presume your ladyship has read Bossu?</p>
<p>LADY FROTH.&nbsp; Oh yes, and Racine, and Dacier upon
Aristotle and Horace.&nbsp; My lord, you must not be jealous,
I&rsquo;m communicating all to Mr. Brisk.</p>
<p>LORD FROTH.&nbsp; No, no, I&rsquo;ll allow Mr. Brisk; have you
nothing about you to shew him, my dear?</p>
<p>LADY FROTH.&nbsp; Yes, I believe I have.&nbsp; Mr. Brisk,
come, will you go into the next room? and there I&rsquo;ll shew
you what I have.</p>
<p>LORD FROTH.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll walk a turn in the garden, and
come to you.</p>
<h4>SCENE III.</h4>
<p><span class="smcap">Mellefont</span>, <span
class="smcap">Cynthia</span>.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re thoughtful, Cynthia?</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m thinking, though marriage makes man and
wife one flesh, it leaves &rsquo;em still two fools; and they
become more conspicuous by setting off one another.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s only when two fools meet, and their
follies are opposed.</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; Nay, I have known two wits meet, and by the
opposition of their wit render themselves as ridiculous as
fools.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis an odd game we&rsquo;re going to play
at.&nbsp; What think you of drawing stakes, and giving over in
time?</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; No, hang&rsquo;t, that&rsquo;s not endeavouring to
win, because it&rsquo;s possible we may lose; since we have
shuffled and cut, let&rsquo;s even turn up trump now.</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; Then I find it&rsquo;s like cards, if either of us
have a good hand it is an accident of fortune.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; No, marriage is rather like a game at bowls:
fortune indeed makes the match, and the two nearest, and
sometimes the two farthest, are together, but the game depends
entirely upon judgment.</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; Still it is a game, and consequently one of us
must be a loser.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; Not at all; only a friendly trial of skill, and the
winnings to be laid out in an entertainment.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s
here, the music?&nbsp; Oh, my lord has promised the company a new
song; we&rsquo;ll get &rsquo;em to give it us by the way.&nbsp;
[<i>Musicians crossing the stage</i>.]&nbsp; Pray let us have the
favour of you, to practise the song before the company hear
it.</p>
<p>SONG.</p>
<p>I.</p>
<p>Cynthia frowns whene&rsquo;er I woo her,<br />
Yet she&rsquo;s vext if I give over;<br />
Much she fears I should undo her,<br />
But much more to lose her lover:<br />
Thus, in doubting, she refuses;<br />
And not winning, thus she loses.</p>
<p>II.</p>
<p>Prithee, Cynthia, look behind you,<br />
Age and wrinkles will o&rsquo;ertake you;<br />
Then too late desire will find you,<br />
When the power must forsake you:<br />
Think, O think o&rsquo; th&rsquo; sad condition,<br />
To be past, yet wish fruition.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; You shall have my thanks below.&nbsp; [<i>To the
musicians</i>, <i>they go out</i>.]</p>
<h4>SCENE IV.</h4>
<p>[<i>To them</i>] <span class="smcap">Sir Paul Plyant</span>
<i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Lady Plyant</span>.</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; Gadsbud!&nbsp; I am provoked into a
fermentation, as my Lady Froth says; was ever the like read of in
story?</p>
<p>LADY PLYANT.&nbsp; Sir Paul, have patience, let me alone to
rattle him up.</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; Pray, your ladyship, give me leave to be
angry.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll rattle him up, I warrant you, I&rsquo;ll
firk him with a <i>certiorari</i>.</p>
<p>LADY PLYANT.&nbsp; You firk him, I&rsquo;ll firk him myself;
pray, Sir Paul, hold you contented.</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; Bless me, what makes my father in such a
passion?&nbsp; I never saw him thus before.</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; Hold yourself contented, my Lady Plyant.&nbsp;
I find passion coming upon me by inflation, and I cannot submit
as formerly, therefore give way.</p>
<p>LADY PLYANT.&nbsp; How now! will you be pleased to retire
and&mdash;</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; No, marry will I not be pleased: I am pleased
to be angry, that&rsquo;s my pleasure at this time.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; What can this mean?</p>
<p>LADY PLYANT.&nbsp; Gads my life, the man&rsquo;s distracted;
why, how now, who are you?&nbsp; What am I?&nbsp; Slidikins,
can&rsquo;t I govern you?&nbsp; What did I marry you for?&nbsp;
Am I not to be absolute and uncontrollable?&nbsp; Is it fit a
woman of my spirit and conduct should be contradicted in a matter
of this concern?</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; It concerns me and only me.&nbsp; Besides,
I&rsquo;m not to be governed at all times.&nbsp; When I am in
tranquillity, my Lady Plyant shall command Sir Paul; but when I
am provoked to fury, I cannot incorporate with patience and
reason: as soon may tigers match with tigers, lambs with lambs,
and every creature couple with its foe, as the poet says.</p>
<p>LADY PLYANT.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s hot-headed still!&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis in vain to talk to you; but remember I have a
curtain-lecture for you, you disobedient, headstrong brute.</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; No, &rsquo;tis because I won&rsquo;t be
headstrong, because I won&rsquo;t be a brute, and have my head
fortified, that I am thus exasperated.&nbsp; But I will protect
my honour, and yonder is the violator of my fame.</p>
<p>LADY PLYANT.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis my honour that is concerned, and
the violation was intended to me.&nbsp; Your honour!&nbsp; You
have none but what is in my keeping, and I can dispose of it when
I please: therefore don&rsquo;t provoke me.</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; Hum, gadsbud, she says true.&nbsp; Well, my
lady, march on; I will fight under you, then: I am convinced, as
far as passion will permit.&nbsp; [<span class="smcap">Lady
Plyant</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Sir Paul</span>
<i>come up to</i> <span class="smcap">Mellefont</span>.]</p>
<p>LADY PLYANT.&nbsp; Inhuman and treacherous&mdash;</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; Thou serpent and first tempter of
womankind.</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; Bless me!&nbsp; Sir, madam, what mean you?</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; Thy, Thy, come away, Thy; touch him not.&nbsp;
Come hither, girl; go not near him, there&rsquo;s nothing but
deceit about him.&nbsp; Snakes are in his peruke, and the
crocodile of Nilus is in his belly; he will eat thee up
alive.</p>
<p>LADY PLYANT.&nbsp; Dishonourable, impudent creature!</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; For heav&rsquo;n&rsquo;s sake, madam, to whom do
you direct this language?</p>
<p>LADY PLYANT.&nbsp; Have I behaved myself with all the decorum
and nicety befitting the person of Sir Paul&rsquo;s wife?&nbsp;
Have I preserved my honour as it were in a snow-house for these
three years past?&nbsp; Have I been white and unsullied even by
Sir Paul himself?</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; Nay, she has been an invincible wife, even to
me; that&rsquo;s the truth on&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>LADY PLYANT.&nbsp; Have I, I say, preserved myself like a fair
sheet of paper for you to make a blot upon?</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; And she shall make a simile with any woman in
England.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; I am so amazed, I know not what to say.</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; Do you think my daughter, this pretty
creature&mdash;gadsbud, she&rsquo;s a wife for a
cherubim!&mdash;do you think her fit for nothing but to be a
stalking horse, to stand before you, while you take aim at my
wife?&nbsp; Gadsbud, I was never angry before in my life, and
I&rsquo;ll never be appeased again.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; Hell and damnation!&nbsp; This is my aunt; such
malice can be engendered nowhere else.&nbsp; [<i>Aside</i>.]</p>
<p>LADY PLYANT.&nbsp; Sir Paul, take Cynthia from his sight;
leave me to strike him with the remorse of his intended
crime.</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; Pray, sir, stay, hear him; I dare affirm
he&rsquo;s innocent.</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; Innocent!&nbsp; Why, hark&rsquo;ee&mdash;come
hither, Thy&mdash;hark&rsquo;ee, I had it from his aunt, my
sister Touchwood.&nbsp; Gadsbud, he does not care a farthing for
anything of thee but thy portion.&nbsp; Why, he&rsquo;s in love
with my wife.&nbsp; He would have tantalised thee, and made a
cuckold of thy poor father, and that would certainly have broke
my heart.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure, if ever I should have horns, they
would kill me; they would never come kindly&mdash;I should die of
&rsquo;em like a child that was cutting his teeth&mdash;I should
indeed, Thy&mdash;therefore come away; but providence has
prevented all, therefore come away when I bid you.</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; I must obey.</p>
<h4>SCENE V.</h4>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Plyant</span>, <span
class="smcap">Mellefont</span>.</p>
<p>LADY PLYANT.&nbsp; Oh, such a thing! the impiety of it
startles me&mdash;to wrong so good, so fair a creature, and one
that loves you tenderly&mdash;&rsquo;tis a barbarity of
barbarities, and nothing could be guilty of it&mdash;</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; But the greatest villain imagination can form, I
grant it; and next to the villainy of such a fact is the villainy
of aspersing me with the guilt.&nbsp; How? which way was I to
wrong her?&nbsp; For yet I understand you not.</p>
<p>LADY PLYANT.&nbsp; Why, gads my life, cousin Mellefont, you
cannot be so peremptory as to deny it, when I tax you with it to
your face? for now Sir Paul&rsquo;s gone, you are <i>corum
nobus</i>.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; By heav&rsquo;n, I love her more than life
or&mdash;</p>
<p>LADY PLYANT.&nbsp; Fiddle faddle, don&rsquo;t tell me of this
and that, and everything in the world, but give me mathemacular
demonstration; answer me directly.&nbsp; But I have not
patience.&nbsp; Oh, the impiety of it, as I was saying, and the
unparalleled wickedness!&nbsp; O merciful Father!&nbsp; How could
you think to reverse nature so, to make the daughter the means of
procuring the mother?</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; The daughter to procure the mother!</p>
<p>LADY PLYANT.&nbsp; Ay, for though I am not Cynthia&rsquo;s own
mother, I am her father&rsquo;s wife, and that&rsquo;s near
enough to make it incest.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; Incest!&nbsp; O my precious aunt, and the devil in
conjunction.&nbsp; [<i>Aside</i>.]</p>
<p>LADY PLYANT.&nbsp; Oh, reflect upon the horror of that, and
then the guilt of deceiving everybody; marrying the daughter,
only to make a cuckold of the father; and then seducing me,
debauching my purity, and perverting me from the road of virtue
in which I have trod thus long, and never made one trip, not one
<i>faux pas</i>.&nbsp; Oh, consider it!&nbsp; What would you have
to answer for if you should provoke me to frailty?&nbsp; Alas!
humanity is feeble, heav&rsquo;n knows! very feeble, and unable
to support itself.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; Where am I? is it day? and am I awake?&nbsp;
Madam&mdash;</p>
<p>LADY PLYANT.&nbsp; And nobody knows how circumstances may
happen together.&nbsp; To my thinking, now I could resist the
strongest temptation.&nbsp; But yet I know, &rsquo;tis impossible
for me to know whether I could or not; there&rsquo;s no certainty
in the things of this life.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; Madam, pray give me leave to ask you one
question.</p>
<p>LADY PLYANT.&nbsp; O Lord, ask me the question; I&rsquo;ll
swear I&rsquo;ll refuse it, I swear I&rsquo;ll deny
it&mdash;therefore don&rsquo;t ask me; nay, you shan&rsquo;t ask
me, I swear I&rsquo;ll deny it.&nbsp; O Gemini, you have brought
all the blood into my face; I warrant I am as red as a
turkey-cock.&nbsp; O fie, cousin Mellefont!</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; Nay, madam, hear me; I mean&mdash;</p>
<p>LADY PLYANT.&nbsp; Hear you?&nbsp; No, no; I&rsquo;ll deny you
first and hear you afterwards.&nbsp; For one does not know how
one&rsquo;s mind may change upon hearing.&nbsp; Hearing is one of
the senses, and all the senses are fallible.&nbsp; I won&rsquo;t
trust my honour, I assure you; my honour is infallible and
uncomeatable.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; For heav&rsquo;n&rsquo;s sake, madam&mdash;</p>
<p>LADY PLYANT.&nbsp; Oh, name it no more.&nbsp; Bless me, how
can you talk of heav&rsquo;n, and have so much wickedness in your
heart?&nbsp; May be you don&rsquo;t think it a sin&mdash;they say
some of you gentlemen don&rsquo;t think it a sin.&nbsp; May be it
is no sin to them that don&rsquo;t think it so; indeed, if I did
not think it a sin&mdash;But still my honour, if it were no
sin.&nbsp; But then, to marry my daughter for the conveniency of
frequent opportunities, I&rsquo;ll never consent to that; as sure
as can be, I&rsquo;ll break the match.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; Death and amazement!&nbsp; Madam, upon my
knees&mdash;</p>
<p>LADY PLYANT.&nbsp; Nay, nay, rise up; come, you shall see my
good-nature.&nbsp; I know love is powerful, and nobody can help
his passion.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis not your fault; nor, I swear, it is
not mine.&nbsp; How can I help it, if I have charms?&nbsp; And
how can you help it, if you are made a captive?&nbsp; I swear it
is pity it should be a fault.&nbsp; But my honour,&mdash;well,
but your honour, too&mdash;but the sin!&mdash;well, but the
necessity&mdash;O Lord, here&rsquo;s somebody coming, I dare not
stay.&nbsp; Well, you must consider of your crime; and strive as
much as can be against it,&mdash;strive, be sure.&nbsp; But
don&rsquo;t be melancholic; don&rsquo;t despair.&nbsp; But never
think that I&rsquo;ll grant you anything.&nbsp; O Lord, no.&nbsp;
But be sure you lay aside all thoughts of the marriage, for
though I know you don&rsquo;t love Cynthia, only as a blind for
your passion to me, yet it will make me jealous.&nbsp; O Lord,
what did I say?&nbsp; Jealous! no, no, I can&rsquo;t be jealous,
for I must not love you; therefore don&rsquo;t hope,&mdash;but
don&rsquo;t despair neither.&nbsp; Oh, they&rsquo;re coming, I
must fly.</p>
<h4>SCENE VI.</h4>
<p><span class="smcap">Mellefont</span> <i>alone</i>.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; [<i>After a pause</i>.]&nbsp; So then, spite of my
care and foresight, I am caught, caught in my security.&nbsp; Yet
this was but a shallow artifice, unworthy of my Machiavellian
aunt.&nbsp; There must be more behind: this is but the first
flash, the priming of her engine.&nbsp; Destruction follows hard,
if not most presently prevented.</p>
<h4>SCENE VII.</h4>
<p>[<i>To him</i>] <span class="smcap">Maskwell</span>.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; Maskwell, welcome, thy presence is a view of land,
appearing to my shipwrecked hopes.&nbsp; The witch has raised the
storm, and her ministers have done their work: you see the
vessels are parted.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; I know it.&nbsp; I met Sir Paul towing away
Cynthia.&nbsp; Come, trouble not your head; I&rsquo;ll join you
together ere to-morrow morning, or drown between you in the
attempt.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s comfort in a hand stretched out to
one that&rsquo;s sinking; though ne&rsquo;er so far off.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; No sinking, nor no danger.&nbsp; Come, cheer up;
why, you don&rsquo;t know that while I plead for you, your aunt
has given me a retaining fee.&nbsp; Nay, I am your greatest
enemy, and she does but journey-work under me.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; Ha! how&rsquo;s this?</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; What d&rsquo;ye think of my being employed in the
execution of all her plots?&nbsp; Ha, ha, ha, by heav&rsquo;n,
it&rsquo;s true: I have undertaken to break the match; I have
undertaken to make your uncle disinherit you; to get you turned
out of doors; and to&mdash;ha, ha, ha, I can&rsquo;t tell you for
laughing.&nbsp; Oh, she has opened her heart to me!&nbsp; I am to
turn you a-grazing, and to&mdash;ha, ha, ha, marry Cynthia
myself.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a plot for you.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; Ha!&nbsp; Oh, see, I see my rising sun!&nbsp; Light
breaks through clouds upon me, and I shall live in day&mdash;Oh,
my Maskwell! how shall I thank or praise thee?&nbsp; Thou hast
outwitted woman.&nbsp; But, tell me, how couldst thou thus get
into her confidence?&nbsp; Ha!&nbsp; How?&nbsp; But was it her
contrivance to persuade my Lady Plyant to this extravagant
belief?</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; It was; and to tell you the truth, I encouraged it
for your diversion.&nbsp; Though it made you a little uneasy for
the present, yet the reflection of it must needs be
entertaining.&nbsp; I warrant she was very violent at first.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; Ha, ha, ha, ay, a very fury; but I was most afraid
of her violence at last.&nbsp; If you had not come as you did, I
don&rsquo;t know what she might have attempted.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; Ha, ha, ha, I know her temper.&nbsp; Well, you
must know, then, that all my contrivances were but bubbles, till
at last I pretended to have been long secretly in love with
Cynthia; that did my business, that convinced your aunt I might
be trusted; since it was as much my interest as hers to break the
match.&nbsp; Then, she thought my jealousy might qualify me to
assist her in her revenge.&nbsp; And, in short, in that belief,
told me the secrets of her heart.&nbsp; At length we made this
agreement, if I accomplish her designs (as I told you before) she
has engaged to put Cynthia with all her fortune into my
power.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; She is most gracious in her favour.&nbsp; Well,
and, dear Jack, how hast thou contrived?</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; I would not have you stay to hear it now; for I
don&rsquo;t know but she may come this way.&nbsp; I am to meet
her anon; after that, I&rsquo;ll tell you the whole matter.&nbsp;
Be here in this gallery an hour hence; by that time I imagine our
consultation may be over.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; I will; till then success attend thee.</p>
<h4>SCENE VIII.</h4>
<p><span class="smcap">Maskwell</span> <i>alone</i>.</p>
<p>Till then, success will attend me; for when I meet you, I meet
the only obstacle to my fortune.&nbsp; Cynthia, let thy beauty
gild my crimes; and whatsoever I commit of treachery or deceit,
shall be imputed to me as a merit.&nbsp; Treachery?&nbsp; What
treachery?&nbsp; Love cancels all the bonds of friendship, and
sets men right upon their first foundations.</p>
<p>Duty to kings, piety to parents, gratitude to benefactors, and
fidelity to friends, are different and particular ties.&nbsp; But
the name of rival cuts &rsquo;em all asunder, and is a general
acquittance.&nbsp; Rival is equal, and love like death an
universal leveller of mankind.&nbsp; Ha!&nbsp; But is there not
such a thing as honesty?&nbsp; Yes, and whosoever has it about
him, bears an enemy in his breast.&nbsp; For your honest man, as
I take it, is that nice, scrupulous, conscientious person, who
will cheat nobody but himself; such another coxcomb as your wise
man, who is too hard for all the world, and will be made a fool
of by nobody but himself; ha, ha, ha.&nbsp; Well, for wisdom and
honesty give me cunning and hypocrisy; oh, &rsquo;tis such a
pleasure to angle for fair-faced fools!&nbsp; Then that hungry
gudgeon credulity will bite at anything.&nbsp; Why, let me see, I
have the same face, the same words and accents when I speak what
I do think, and when I speak what I do not think, the very same;
and dear dissimulation is the only art not to be known from
nature.</p>
<blockquote><p>Why will mankind be fools, and be deceived,<br />
And why are friends&rsquo; and lovers&rsquo; oaths believed,<br
/>
When each, who searches strictly his own mind,<br />
May so much fraud and power of baseness find?</p>

<h3>ACT III.</h3>
<h4>SCENE I.</h4>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Touchwood</span> <i>and</i> <span
class="smcap">Lady Touchwood</span>.</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; My lord, can you blame my brother Plyant if
he refuse his daughter upon this provocation?&nbsp; The
contract&rsquo;s void by this unheard-of impiety.</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t believe it true; he has better
principles.&nbsp; Pho, &rsquo;tis nonsense.&nbsp; Come, come, I
know my Lady Plyant has a large eye, and would centre everything
in her own circle; &rsquo;tis not the first time she has mistaken
respect for love, and made Sir Paul jealous of the civility of an
undesigning person, the better to bespeak his security in her
unfeigned pleasures.</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; You censure hardly, my lord; my
sister&rsquo;s honour is very well known.</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; Yes, I believe I know some that have been
familiarly acquainted with it.&nbsp; This is a little trick
wrought by some pitiful contriver, envious of my nephew&rsquo;s
merit.</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; Nay, my lord, it may be so, and I hope it
will be found so.&nbsp; But that will require some time; for in
such a case as this, demonstration is necessary.</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; There should have been demonstration of the
contrary too, before it had been believed.</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; So I suppose there was.</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; How?&nbsp; Where?&nbsp; When?</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; That I can&rsquo;t tell; nay, I don&rsquo;t
say there was.&nbsp; I am willing to believe as favourably of my
nephew as I can.</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know that.&nbsp; [<i>Half
aside</i>.]</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; How?&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you believe that, say
you, my lord?</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; No, I don&rsquo;t say so.&nbsp; I confess I
am troubled to find you so cold in his defence.</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; His defence!&nbsp; Bless me, would you have
me defend an ill thing?</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; You believe it, then?</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know; I am very unwilling to
speak my thoughts in anything that may be to my cousin&rsquo;s
disadvantage: besides, I find, my lord, you are prepared to
receive an ill impression from any opinion of mine which is not
consenting with your own.&nbsp; But, since I am like to be
suspected in the end, and &rsquo;tis a pain any longer to
dissemble, I own it to you; in short I do believe it, nay, and
can believe anything worse, if it were laid to his charge.&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t ask me my reasons, my lord, for they are not fit to
be told you.</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m amazed: there must be something
more than ordinary in this.&nbsp; [<i>Aside</i>.]&nbsp; Not fit
to be told me, madam?&nbsp; You can have no interests wherein I
am not concerned, and consequently the same reasons ought to be
convincing to me, which create your satisfaction or disquiet.</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; But those which cause my disquiet I am
willing to have remote from your hearing.&nbsp; Good my lord,
don&rsquo;t press me.</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t oblige me to press you.</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; Whatever it was, &rsquo;tis past.&nbsp; And
that is better to be unknown which cannot be prevented; therefore
let me beg you to rest satisfied.</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; When you have told me, I will.</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; You won&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; By my life, my dear, I will.</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; What if you can&rsquo;t?</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; How?&nbsp; Then I must know, nay, I
will.&nbsp; No more trifling.&nbsp; I charge you tell me.&nbsp;
By all our mutual peace to come; upon your duty&mdash;</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; Nay, my lord, you need say no more, to make
me lay my heart before you, but don&rsquo;t be thus transported;
compose yourself.&nbsp; It is not of concern to make you lose one
minute&rsquo;s temper.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis not, indeed, my
dear.&nbsp; Nay, by this kiss you shan&rsquo;t be angry.&nbsp; O
Lord, I wish I had not told you anything.&nbsp; Indeed, my lord,
you have frighted me.&nbsp; Nay, look pleased, I&rsquo;ll tell
you.</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; Well, well.</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; Nay, but will you be calm?&nbsp; Indeed
it&rsquo;s nothing but&mdash;</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; But what?</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; But will you promise me not to be
angry?&nbsp; Nay, you must&mdash;not to be angry with
Mellefont?&nbsp; I dare swear he&rsquo;s sorry, and were it to do
again, would not&mdash;</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; Sorry for what?&nbsp; &rsquo;Death, you rack
me with delay.</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; Nay, no great matter, only&mdash;well, I
have your promise.&nbsp; Pho, why nothing, only your nephew had a
mind to amuse himself sometimes with a little gallantry towards
me.&nbsp; Nay, I can&rsquo;t think he meant anything seriously,
but methought it looked oddly.</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; Confusion and hell, what do I hear?</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; Or, may be, he thought he was not enough
akin to me, upon your account, and had a mind to create a nearer
relation on his own; a lover you know, my lord.&nbsp; Ha, ha,
ha.&nbsp; Well, but that&rsquo;s all.&nbsp; Now you have it; well
remember your promise, my lord, and don&rsquo;t take any notice
of it to him.</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; No, no, no.&nbsp; Damnation!</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; Nay, I swear you must not.&nbsp; A little
harmless mirth; only misplaced, that&rsquo;s all.&nbsp; But if it
were more, &rsquo;tis over now, and all&rsquo;s well.&nbsp; For
my part I have forgot it, and so has he, I hope,&mdash;for I have
not heard anything from him these two days.</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; These two days!&nbsp; Is it so fresh?&nbsp;
Unnatural villain!&nbsp; Death, I&rsquo;ll have him stripped and
turned naked out of my doors this moment, and let him rot and
perish, incestuous brute!</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; Oh, for heav&rsquo;n&rsquo;s sake, my lord,
you&rsquo;ll ruin me if you take such public notice of it; it
will be a town talk.&nbsp; Consider your own and my honour; nay,
I told you you would not be satisfied when you knew it.</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; Before I&rsquo;ve done I will be
satisfied.&nbsp; Ungrateful monster! how long?</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; Lord, I don&rsquo;t know; I wish my lips had
grown together when I told you.&nbsp; Almost a twelvemonth.&nbsp;
Nay, I won&rsquo;t tell you any more till you are yourself.&nbsp;
Pray, my lord, don&rsquo;t let the company see you in this
disorder.&nbsp; Yet, I confess, I can&rsquo;t blame you; for I
think I was never so surprised in my life.&nbsp; Who would have
thought my nephew could have so misconstrued my kindness?&nbsp;
But will you go into your closet, and recover your temper.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll make an excuse of sudden business to the company, and
come to you.&nbsp; Pray, good, dear my lord, let me beg you do
now.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll come immediately and tell you all; will
you, my lord?</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; I will&mdash;I am mute with wonder.</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; Well, but go now, here&rsquo;s somebody
coming.</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; Well, I go.&nbsp; You won&rsquo;t stay? for
I would hear more of this.</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; I follow instantly.&nbsp; So.</p>
<h4>SCENE II.</h4>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Touchwood</span>, <span
class="smcap">Maskwell</span>.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; This was a masterpiece, and did not need my help,
though I stood ready for a cue to come in and confirm all, had
there been occasion.</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; Have you seen Mellefont?</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; I have; and am to meet him here about this
time.</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; How does he bear his disappointment?</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; Secure in my assistance, he seemed not much
afflicted, but rather laughed at the shallow artifice, which so
little time must of necessity discover.&nbsp; Yet he is
apprehensive of some farther design of yours, and has engaged me
to watch you.&nbsp; I believe he will hardly be able to prevent
your plot, yet I would have you use caution and expedition.</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; Expedition indeed, for all we do must be
performed in the remaining part of this evening, and before the
company break up, lest my lord should cool and have an
opportunity to talk with him privately.&nbsp; My lord must not
see him again.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; By no means; therefore you must aggravate my
lord&rsquo;s displeasure to a degree that will admit of no
conference with him.&nbsp; What think you of mentioning me?</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; How?</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; To my lord, as having been privy to
Mellefont&rsquo;s design upon you, but still using my utmost
endeavours to dissuade him, though my friendship and love to him
has made me conceal it; yet you may say, I threatened the next
time he attempted anything of that kind to discover it to my
lord.</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; To what end is this?</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; It will confirm my lord&rsquo;s opinion of my
honour and honesty, and create in him a new confidence in me,
which (should this design miscarry) will be necessary to the
forming another plot that I have in my head.&mdash;To cheat you
as well as the rest.&nbsp; [<i>Aside</i>.]</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll do it&mdash;I&rsquo;ll tell him
you hindered him once from forcing me.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; Excellent!&nbsp; Your ladyship has a most
improving fancy.&nbsp; You had best go to my lord, keep him as
long as you can in his closet, and I doubt not but you will mould
him to what you please; your guests are so engaged in their own
follies and intrigues, they&rsquo;ll miss neither of you.</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; When shall we meet?&mdash;at eight this
evening in my chamber?&nbsp; There rejoice at our success, and
toy away an hour in mirth.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; I will not fail.</p>
<h4>SCENE III.</h4>
<p><span class="smcap">Maskwell</span> <i>alone</i>.</p>
<p>I know what she means by toying away an hour well
enough.&nbsp; Pox, I have lost all appetite to her; yet
she&rsquo;s a fine woman, and I loved her once.&nbsp; But I
don&rsquo;t know: since I have been in a great measure kept by
her, the case is altered; what was my pleasure is become my duty,
and I have as little stomach to her now as if I were her
husband.&nbsp; Should she smoke my design upon Cynthia, I were in
a fine pickle.&nbsp; She has a damned penetrating head, and knows
how to interpret a coldness the right way; therefore I must
dissemble ardour and ecstasy; that&rsquo;s resolved.&nbsp; How
easily and pleasantly is that dissembled before fruition!&nbsp;
Pox on&rsquo;t that a man can&rsquo;t drink without quenching his
thirst.&nbsp; Ha! yonder comes Mellefont, thoughtful.&nbsp; Let
me think.&nbsp; Meet her at eight&mdash;hum&mdash;ha!&nbsp; By
heav&rsquo;n I have it.&mdash;If I can speak to my lord
before.&nbsp; Was it my brain or providence?&nbsp; No matter
which&mdash;I will deceive &rsquo;em all, and yet secure
myself.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas a lucky thought!&nbsp; Well, this
double-dealing is a jewel.&nbsp; Here he comes, now for me.&nbsp;
[<span class="smcap">Maskwell</span>, <i>pretending not to see
him</i>, <i>walks by him</i>, <i>and speaks as it were to
himself</i>.]</p>
<h4>SCENE IV.</h4>
<p>[<i>To him</i>] <span class="smcap">Mellefont</span>,
<i>musing</i>.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; Mercy on us, what will the wickedness of this
world come to?</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; How now, Jack?&nbsp; What, so full of contemplation
that you run over?</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re come, for I could not
contain myself any longer, and was just going to give vent to a
secret, which nobody but you ought to drink down.&nbsp; Your
aunt&rsquo;s just gone from hence.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; And having trusted thee with the secrets of her
soul, thou art villainously bent to discover &rsquo;em all to me,
ha?</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m afraid my frailty leans that way.&nbsp;
But I don&rsquo;t know whether I can in honour discover &rsquo;em
all.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; All, all, man!&nbsp; What, you may in honour betray
her as far as she betrays herself.&nbsp; No tragical design upon
my person, I hope.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; No, but it&rsquo;s a comical design upon mine.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; What dost thou mean?</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; Listen and be dumb; we have been bargaining about
the rate of your ruin&mdash;</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; Like any two guardians to an orphan heiress.&nbsp;
Well?</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; And whereas pleasure is generally paid with
mischief, what mischief I do is to be paid with pleasure.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; So when you&rsquo;ve swallowed the potion you
sweeten your mouth with a plum.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; You are merry, sir, but I shall probe your
constitution.&nbsp; In short, the price of your banishment is to
be paid with the person of&mdash;</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; Of Cynthia and her fortune.&nbsp; Why, you forget
you told me this before.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; No, no.&nbsp; So far you are right; and I am, as
an earnest of that bargain, to have full and free possession of
the person of&mdash;your aunt.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; Ha!&nbsp; Pho, you trifle.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; By this light, I&rsquo;m serious; all raillery
apart.&nbsp; I knew &rsquo;twould stun you.&nbsp; This evening at
eight she will receive me in her bedchamber.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; Hell and the devil, is she abandoned of all
grace?&nbsp; Why, the woman is possessed.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; Well, will you go in my stead?</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; By heav&rsquo;n, into a hot furnace sooner.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; No, you would not; it would not be so convenient,
as I can order matters.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; What d&rsquo;ye mean?</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; Mean?&nbsp; Not to disappoint the lady, I assure
you.&nbsp; Ha, ha, ha, how gravely he looks.&nbsp; Come, come, I
won&rsquo;t perplex you.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis the only thing that
providence could have contrived to make me capable of serving
you, either to my inclination or your own necessity.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; How, how, for heav&rsquo;n&rsquo;s sake, dear
Maskwell?</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; Why, thus.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll go according to
appointment; you shall have notice at the critical minute to come
and surprise your aunt and me together.&nbsp; Counterfeit a rage
against me, and I&rsquo;ll make my escape through the private
passage from her chamber, which I&rsquo;ll take care to leave
open.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twill be hard if then you can&rsquo;t bring
her to any conditions.&nbsp; For this discovery will disarm her
of all defence, and leave her entirely at your mercy&mdash;nay,
she must ever after be in awe of you.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; Let me adore thee, my better genius!&nbsp; By
heav&rsquo;n I think it is not in the power of fate to disappoint
my hopes&mdash;my hopes?&nbsp; My certainty!</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; Well, I&rsquo;ll meet you here, within a quarter
of eight, and give you notice.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; Good fortune ever go along with thee.</p>
<h4>SCENE V.</h4>
<p><span class="smcap">Mellefont</span>, <span
class="smcap">Careless</span>.</p>
<p>CARE.&nbsp; Mellefont, get out o&rsquo; th&rsquo; way, my Lady
Plyant&rsquo;s coming, and I shall never succeed while thou art
in sight.&nbsp; Though she begins to tack about; but I made love
a great while to no purpose.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; Why, what&rsquo;s the matter?&nbsp; She&rsquo;s
convinced that I don&rsquo;t care for her.</p>
<p>CARE.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t get an answer from her, that does
not begin with her honour, or her virtue, her religion, or some
such cant.&nbsp; Then she has told me the whole history of Sir
Paul&rsquo;s nine years courtship; how he has lain for whole
nights together upon the stairs before her chamber-door; and that
the first favour he received from her was a piece of an old
scarlet petticoat for a stomacher, which since the day of his
marriage he has out of a piece of gallantry converted into a
night-cap, and wears it still with much solemnity on his
anniversary wedding-night.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; That I have seen, with the ceremony thereunto
belonging.&nbsp; For on that night he creeps in at the
bed&rsquo;s feet like a gulled bassa that has married a relation
of the Grand Signior, and that night he has his arms at
liberty.&nbsp; Did not she tell you at what a distance she keeps
him?&nbsp; He has confessed to me that, but at some certain
times, that is, I suppose, when she apprehends being with child,
he never has the privilege of using the familiarity of a husband
with a wife.&nbsp; He was once given to scrambling with his
hands, and sprawling in his sleep, and ever since she has him
swaddled up in blankets, and his hands and feet swathed down, and
so put to bed; and there he lies with a great beard, like a
Russian bear upon a drift of snow.&nbsp; You are very great with
him, I wonder he never told you his grievances: he will, I
warrant you.</p>
<p>CARE.&nbsp; Excessively foolish!&nbsp; But that which gives me
most hopes of her is her telling me of the many temptations she
has resisted.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; Nay, then you have her; for a woman&rsquo;s
bragging to a man that she has overcome temptations is an
argument that they were weakly offered, and a challenge to him to
engage her more irresistibly.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis only an enhancing
the price of the commodity, by telling you how many customers
have underbid her.</p>
<p>CARE.&nbsp; Nay, I don&rsquo;t despair.&nbsp; But still she
has a grudging to you.&nbsp; I talked to her t&rsquo;other night
at my Lord Froth&rsquo;s masquerade, when I&rsquo;m satisfied she
knew me, and I had no reason to complain of my reception; but I
find women are not the same bare-faced and in masks, and a vizor
disguises their inclinations as much as their faces.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis a mistake, for women may most properly
be said to be unmasked when they wear vizors; for that secures
them from blushing and being out of countenance, and next to
being in the dark, or alone, they are most truly themselves in a
vizor mask.&nbsp; Here they come: I&rsquo;ll leave you.&nbsp; Ply
her close, and by and by clap a <i>billet doux</i> into her hand;
for a woman never thinks a man truly in love with her, till he
has been fool enough to think of her out of her sight, and to
lose so much time as to write to her.</p>
<h4>SCENE VI.</h4>
<p><span class="smcap">Careless</span>, <span class="smcap">Sir
Paul</span>, <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Lady
Plyant</span>.</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; Shan&rsquo;t we disturb your meditation, Mr.
Careless?&nbsp; You would be private?</p>
<p>CARE.&nbsp; You bring that along with you, Sir Paul, that
shall be always welcome to my privacy.</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; O sweet sir, you load your humble servants,
both me and my wife, with continual favours.</p>
<p>LADY PLYANT.&nbsp; Sir Paul, what a phrase was there?&nbsp;
You will be making answers, and taking that upon you which ought
to lie upon me.&nbsp; That you should have so little breeding to
think Mr. Careless did not apply himself to me.&nbsp; Pray what
have you to entertain anybody&rsquo;s privacy?&nbsp; I swear and
declare in the face of the world I&rsquo;m ready to blush for
your ignorance.</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; I acquiesce, my lady; but don&rsquo;t snub so
loud.&nbsp; [<i>Aside to her</i>.]</p>
<p>LADY PLYANT.&nbsp; Mr. Careless, if a person that is wholly
illiterate might be supposed to be capable of being qualified to
make a suitable return to those obligations, which you are
pleased to confer upon one that is wholly incapable of being
qualified in all those circumstances, I&rsquo;m sure I should
rather attempt it than anything in the world, [<i>Courtesies</i>]
for I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s nothing in the world that I
would rather.&nbsp; [<i>Courtesies</i>]&nbsp; But I know Mr.
Careless is so great a critic, and so fine a gentleman, that it
is impossible for me&mdash;</p>
<p>CARE.&nbsp; O heavens! madam, you confound me.</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; Gads-bud, she&rsquo;s a fine person.</p>
<p>LADY PLYANT.&nbsp; O Lord! sir, pardon me, we women have not
those advantages; I know my imperfections.&nbsp; But at the same
time you must give me leave to declare in the face of the world
that nobody is more sensible of favours and things; for with the
reserve of my honour I assure you, Mr. Careless, I don&rsquo;t
know anything in the world I would refuse to a person so
meritorious.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll pardon my want of expression.</p>
<p>CARE.&nbsp; O, your ladyship is abounding in all excellence,
particularly that of phrase.</p>
<p>LADY PLYANT.&nbsp; You are so obliging, sir.</p>
<p>CARE.&nbsp; Your ladyship is so charming.</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; So, now, now; now, my lady.</p>
<p>LADY PLYANT.&nbsp; So well bred.</p>
<p>CARE.&nbsp; So surprising.</p>
<p>LADY PLYANT.&nbsp; So well dressed, so <i>bonne mine</i>, so
eloquent, so unaffected, so easy, so free, so particular, so
agreeable.</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; Ay, so, so, there.</p>
<p>CARE.&nbsp; O Lord, I beseech you madam, don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>LADY PLYANT.&nbsp; So gay, so graceful, so good teeth, so fine
shape, so fine limbs, so fine linen, and I don&rsquo;t doubt but
you have a very good skin, sir,</p>
<p>CARE.&nbsp; For heaven&rsquo;s sake, madam, I&rsquo;m quite
out of countenance.</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; And my lady&rsquo;s quite out of breath; or
else you should hear&mdash;Gads-bud, you may talk of my Lady
Froth.</p>
<p>CARE.&nbsp; O fie, fie, not to be named of a day.&nbsp; My
Lady Froth is very well in her accomplishments.&nbsp; But it is
when my Lady Plyant is not thought of.&nbsp; If that can ever
be.</p>
<p>LADY PLYANT.&nbsp; O, you overcome me.&nbsp; That is so
excessive.</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; Nay, I swear and vow that was pretty.</p>
<p>CARE.&nbsp; O, Sir Paul, you are the happiest man alive.&nbsp;
Such a lady! that is the envy of her own sex, and the admiration
of ours.</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; Your humble servant.&nbsp; I am, I thank
heaven, in a fine way of living, as I may say, peacefully and
happily, and I think need not envy any of my neighbours, blessed
be providence.&nbsp; Ay, truly, Mr. Careless, my lady is a great
blessing, a fine, discreet, well-spoken woman as you shall see,
if it becomes me to say so, and we live very comfortably
together; she is a little hasty sometimes, and so am I; but
mine&rsquo;s soon over, and then I&rsquo;m so sorry.&mdash;O Mr.
Careless, if it were not for one thing&mdash;</p>
<h4>SCENE VII.</h4>
<p><span class="smcap">Careless</span>, <span class="smcap">Sir
Paul</span>, <span class="smcap">Lady Plyant</span>, <span

<p>LADY PLYANT.&nbsp; How often have you been told of that, you
jackanapes?</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; Gad so, gad&rsquo;s-bud.&nbsp; Tim, carry it
to my lady, you should have carried it to my lady first.</p>
<p>BOY.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis directed to your worship.</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; Well, well, my lady reads all letters
first.&nbsp; Child, do so no more; d&rsquo;ye hear, Tim.</p>
<p>BOY.&nbsp; No, and please you.</p>
<h4>SCENE VIII.</h4>
<p><span class="smcap">Careless</span>, <span class="smcap">Sir
Paul</span>, <span class="smcap">Lady Plyant</span>.</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; A humour of my wife&rsquo;s: you know women
have little fancies.&nbsp; But as I was telling you, Mr.
Careless, if it were not for one thing, I should think myself the
happiest man in the world; indeed that touches me near, very
near.</p>
<p>CARE.&nbsp; What can that be, Sir Paul?</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; Why, I have, I thank heaven, a very plentiful
fortune, a good estate in the country, some houses in town, and
some money, a pretty tolerable personal estate; and it is a great
grief to me, indeed it is, Mr. Careless, that I have not a son to
inherit this.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis true I have a daughter, and a fine
dutiful child she is, though I say it, blessed be providence I
may say; for indeed, Mr. Careless, I am mightily beholden to
providence.&nbsp; A poor unworthy sinner.&nbsp; But if I had a
son!&nbsp; Ah, that&rsquo;s my affliction, and my only
affliction; indeed I cannot refrain tears when it comes in my
mind.&nbsp; [<i>Cries</i>.]</p>
<p>CARE.&nbsp; Why, methinks that might be easily
remedied&mdash;my lady&rsquo;s a fine likely woman&mdash;</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; Oh, a fine likely woman as you shall see in a
summer&rsquo;s day.&nbsp; Indeed she is, Mr. Careless, in all
respects.</p>
<p>CARE.&nbsp; And I should not have taken you to have been so
old&mdash;</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; Alas, that&rsquo;s not it, Mr. Careless; ah!
that&rsquo;s not it; no, no, you shoot wide of the mark a mile;
indeed you do, that&rsquo;s not it, Mr. Careless; no, no,
that&rsquo;s not it.</p>
<p>CARE.&nbsp; No?&nbsp; What can be the matter then?</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll scarcely believe me when I shall
tell you&mdash;my lady is so nice.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s very strange,
but it&rsquo;s true; too true&mdash;she&rsquo;s so very nice,
that I don&rsquo;t believe she would touch a man for the
world.&nbsp; At least not above once a year; I&rsquo;m sure I
have found it so; and, alas, what&rsquo;s once a year to an old
man, who would do good in his generation?&nbsp; Indeed it&rsquo;s
true, Mr. Careless, it breaks my heart.&nbsp; I am her husband,
as I may say; though far unworthy of that honour, yet I am her
husband; but alas-a-day, I have no more familiarity with her
person&mdash;as to that matter&mdash;than with my own
mother&mdash;no indeed.</p>
<p>CARE.&nbsp; Alas-a-day, this is a lamentable story.&nbsp; My
lady must be told on&rsquo;t.&nbsp; She must i&rsquo;faith, Sir
Paul; &rsquo;tis an injury to the world.</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; Ah! would to heaven you would, Mr. Careless;
you are mightily in her favour.</p>
<p>CARE.&nbsp; I warrant you, what! we must have a son some way
or other.</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; Indeed I should be mightily bound to you if
you could bring it about, Mr. Careless.</p>
<p>LADY PLYANT.&nbsp; Here, Sir Paul, it&rsquo;s from your
steward.&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s a return of 600 pounds; you may take
fifty of it for the next half year.&nbsp; [<i>Gives him the

<h4>SCENE IX.</h4>
<p>[<i>To them</i>] <span class="smcap">Lord Froth</span>, <span
class="smcap">Cynthia</span>.</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; How does my girl?&nbsp; Come hither to thy
father, poor lamb: thou&rsquo;rt melancholic.</p>
<p>LORD FROTH.&nbsp; Heaven, Sir Paul, you amaze me, of all
things in the world.&nbsp; You are never pleased but when we are
all upon the broad grin: all laugh and no company; ah, then
&rsquo;tis such a sight to see some teeth.&nbsp; Sure
you&rsquo;re a great admirer of my Lady Whifler, Mr. Sneer, and
Sir Laurence Loud, and that gang.</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; I vow and swear she&rsquo;s a very merry
woman; but I think she laughs a little too much.</p>
<p>LORD FROTH.&nbsp; Merry!&nbsp; O Lord, what a character that
is of a woman of quality.&nbsp; You have been at my Lady
Whifler&rsquo;s upon her day, madam?</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; Yes, my lord.&nbsp; I must humour this fool.&nbsp;
[<i>Aside</i>.]</p>
<p>LORD FROTH.&nbsp; Well, and how? hee!&nbsp; What is your sense
of the conversation?</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; Oh, most ridiculous, a perpetual comfort of
laughing without any harmony; for sure, my lord, to laugh out of
time, is as disagreeable as to sing out of time or out of
tune.</p>
<p>LORD FROTH.&nbsp; Hee, hee, hee, right; and then, my Lady
Whifler is so ready&mdash;she always comes in three bars too
soon.&nbsp; And then, what do they laugh at?&nbsp; For you know
laughing without a jest is as impertinent, hee! as, as&mdash;</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; As dancing without a fiddle.</p>
<p>LORD FROTH.&nbsp; Just i&rsquo;faith, that was at my
tongue&rsquo;s end.</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; But that cannot be properly said of them, for I
think they are all in good nature with the world, and only laugh
at one another; and you must allow they have all jests in their
persons, though they have none in their conversation.</p>
<p>LORD FROTH.&nbsp; True, as I&rsquo;m a person of honour.&nbsp;
For heaven&rsquo;s sake let us sacrifice &rsquo;em to mirth a
little.&nbsp; [<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Boy</span> <i>and

<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; Gads so.&mdash;Wife, wife, my Lady Plyant, I
have a word.</p>
<p>LADY PLYANT.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m busy, Sir Paul, I wonder at your
impertinence.</p>
<p>CARE.&nbsp; Sir Paul, harkee, I&rsquo;m reasoning the matter
you know.&nbsp; Madam, if your ladyship please, we&rsquo;ll
discourse of this in the next room.</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; O ho, I wish you good success, I wish you good
success.&nbsp; Boy, tell my lady, when she has done, I would
speak with her below.</p>

Froth</span>, <span class="smcap">Lady Froth</span>, <span
class="smcap">Brisk</span>.</p>
<p>LADY FROTH.&nbsp; Then you think that episode between Susan,
the dairy-maid, and our coachman is not amiss; you know, I may
suppose the dairy in town, as well as in the country.</p>
<p>BRISK.&nbsp; Incomparable, let me perish.&nbsp; But then,
being an heroic poem, had you not better call him a
charioteer?&nbsp; Charioteer sounds great; besides, your
ladyship&rsquo;s coachman having a red face, and you comparing
him to the sun&mdash;and you know the sun is called
Heaven&rsquo;s charioteer.</p>
<p>LADY FROTH.&nbsp; Oh, infinitely better; I&rsquo;m extremely
beholden to you for the hint; stay, we&rsquo;ll read over those
half a score lines again.&nbsp; [<i>Pulls out a paper</i>.]&nbsp;
Let me see here, you know what goes before,&mdash;the comparison,
you know.&nbsp; [<i>Reads</i>.]</p>
<blockquote><p>For as the sun shines ev&rsquo;ry day,<br />
So of our coachman I may say.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>BRISK.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m afraid that simile won&rsquo;t do in
wet weather; because you say the sun shines every day.</p>
<p>LADY FROTH.&nbsp; No; for the sun it won&rsquo;t, but it will
do for the coachman, for you know there&rsquo;s most occasion for
a coach in wet weather.</p>
<p>BRISK.&nbsp; Right, right, that saves all.</p>
<p>LADY FROTH.&nbsp; Then I don&rsquo;t say the sun shines all
the day, but that he peeps now and then; yet he does shine all
the day too, you know, though we don&rsquo;t see him.</p>
<p>BRISK.&nbsp; Right, but the vulgar will never comprehend
that.</p>
<p>LADY FROTH.&nbsp; Well, you shall hear.&nbsp; Let me
see.&nbsp; [<i>Reads</i>.]</p>
<blockquote><p>For as the sun shines ev&rsquo;ry day,<br />
So of our coachman I may say,<br />
He shows his drunken fiery face,<br />
Just as the sun does, more or less.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>BRISK.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s right, all&rsquo;s well, all&rsquo;s
well.&nbsp; &lsquo;More or less.&rsquo;</p>
<p>LADY FROTH reads:</p>
<blockquote><p>And when at night his labour&rsquo;s done,<br />
Then too, like Heav&rsquo;n&rsquo;s charioteer the sun:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ay, charioteer does better.</p>
<blockquote><p>Into the dairy he descends,<br />
And there his whipping and his driving ends;<br />
There he&rsquo;s secure from danger of a bilk,<br />
His fare is paid him, and he sets in milk.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For Susan you know, is Thetis, and so&mdash;</p>
<p>BRISK.&nbsp; Incomparable well and proper, egad&mdash;but I
have one exception to make&mdash;don&rsquo;t you think
bilk&mdash;(I know it&rsquo;s good rhyme)&mdash;but don&rsquo;t
you think <i>bilk</i> and <i>fare</i> too like a hackney
coachman?</p>
<p>LADY FROTH.&nbsp; I swear and vow I&rsquo;m afraid so.&nbsp;
And yet our Jehu was a hackney coachman, when my lord took
him.</p>
<p>BRISK.&nbsp; Was he?&nbsp; I&rsquo;m answered, if Jehu was a
hackney coachman.&nbsp; You may put that in the marginal notes
though, to prevent criticism&mdash;only mark it with a small
asterism, and say, &lsquo;Jehu was formerly a hackney
coachman.&rsquo;</p>
<p>LADY FROTH.&nbsp; I will.&nbsp; You&rsquo;d oblige me
extremely to write notes to the whole poem.</p>
<p>BRISK.&nbsp; With all my heart and soul, and proud of the vast
honour, let me perish.</p>
<p>LORD FROTH.&nbsp; Hee, hee, hee, my dear, have you done?
won&rsquo;t you join with us?&nbsp; We were laughing at my Lady
Whifler and Mr. Sneer.</p>
<p>LADY FROTH.&nbsp; Ay, my dear, were you?&nbsp; Oh, filthy Mr.
Sneer; he&rsquo;s a nauseous figure, a most fulsamic fop,
foh!&nbsp; He spent two days together in going about Covent
Garden to suit the lining of his coach with his complexion.</p>
<p>LORD FROTH.&nbsp; O silly! yet his aunt is as fond of him as
if she had brought the ape into the world herself.</p>
<p>BRISK.&nbsp; Who, my Lady Toothless?&nbsp; Oh, she&rsquo;s a
mortifying spectacle; she&rsquo;s always chewing the cud like an
old ewe.</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; Fie, Mr. Brisk, eringo&rsquo;s for her cough.</p>
<p>LADY FROTH.&nbsp; I have seen her take &rsquo;em half chewed
out of her mouth, to laugh, and then put &rsquo;em in
again.&nbsp; Foh!</p>
<p>LORD FROTH.&nbsp; Foh!</p>
<p>LADY FROTH.&nbsp; Then she&rsquo;s always ready to laugh when
Sneer offers to speak, and sits in expectation of his no jest,
with her gums bare, and her mouth open&mdash;</p>
<p>BRISK.&nbsp; Like an oyster at low ebb, egad.&nbsp; Ha, ha,
ha!</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; [<i>Aside</i>]&nbsp; Well, I find there are no
fools so inconsiderable in themselves but they can render other
people contemptible by exposing their infirmities.</p>
<p>LADY FROTH.&nbsp; Then that t&rsquo;other great strapping
lady&mdash;I can&rsquo;t hit of her name; the old fat fool that
paints so exorbitantly.</p>
<p>BRISK.&nbsp; I know whom you mean&mdash;but deuce take me, I
can&rsquo;t hit of her name neither.&nbsp; Paints, d&rsquo;ye
say?&nbsp; Why, she lays it on with a trowel.&nbsp; Then she has
a great beard that bristles through it, and makes her look as if
she were plastered with lime and hair, let me perish.</p>
<p>LADY FROTH.&nbsp; Oh, you made a song upon her, Mr. Brisk.</p>
<p>BRISK.&nbsp; He! egad, so I did.&nbsp; My lord can sing
it.</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; O good, my lord, let&rsquo;s hear it.</p>
<p>BRISK.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis not a song neither, it&rsquo;s a sort
of an epigram, or rather an epigrammatic sonnet; I don&rsquo;t
know what to call it, but it&rsquo;s satire.&nbsp; Sing it, my
lord.</p>
<p>LORD FROTH sings.</p>
<blockquote><p>Ancient Phyllis has young graces,<br />
&rsquo;Tis a strange thing, but a true one;<br />
Shall I tell you how?<br />
She herself makes her own faces,<br />
And each morning wears a new one;<br />
Where&rsquo;s the wonder now?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>BRISK.&nbsp; Short, but there&rsquo;s salt in&rsquo;t; my way
of writing, egad.</p>
<h4>SCENE XI.</h4>
<p>[<i>To them</i>] <span class="smcap">Footman</span>.</p>
<p>LADY FROTH.&nbsp; How now?</p>
<p>FOOT.&nbsp; Your ladyship&rsquo;s chair is come.</p>
<p>LADY FROTH.&nbsp; Is nurse and the child in it?</p>
<p>FOOT.&nbsp; Yes, madam.</p>
<p>LADY FROTH.&nbsp; O the dear creature!&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s go
see it.</p>
<p>LORD FROTH.&nbsp; I swear, my dear, you&rsquo;ll spoil that
child, with sending it to and again so often; this is the seventh
time the chair has gone for her to-day.</p>
<p>LADY FROTH.&nbsp; O law!&nbsp; I swear it&rsquo;s but the
sixth&mdash;and I haven&rsquo;t seen her these two hours.&nbsp;
The poor creature&mdash;I swear, my lord, you don&rsquo;t love
poor little Sapho.&nbsp; Come, my dear Cynthia, Mr. Brisk,
we&rsquo;ll go see Sapho, though my lord won&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll wait upon your ladyship.</p>
<p>BRISK.&nbsp; Pray, madam, how old is Lady Sapho?</p>
<p>LADY FROTH.&nbsp; Three-quarters, but I swear she has a world
of wit, and can sing a tune already.&nbsp; My lord, won&rsquo;t
you go?&nbsp; Won&rsquo;t you?&nbsp; What! not to see Saph?&nbsp;
Pray, my lord, come see little Saph.&nbsp; I knew you could not
stay.</p>
<h4>SCENE XII.</h4>
<p><span class="smcap">Cynthia</span> <i>alone</i>.</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis not so hard to counterfeit joy in the
depth of affliction, as to dissemble mirth in company of
fools.&nbsp; Why should I call &rsquo;em fools?&nbsp; The world
thinks better of &rsquo;em; for these have quality and education,
wit and fine conversation, are received and admired by the
world.&nbsp; If not, they like and admire themselves.&nbsp; And
why is not that true wisdom? for &rsquo;tis happiness: and for
ought I know, we have misapplied the name all this while, and
mistaken the thing: since</p>
<blockquote><p>If happiness in self-content is placed,<br />
The wise are wretched, and fools only bless&rsquo;d.</p>

<h3>ACT IV.</h3>
<h4>SCENE I.</h4>
<p><span class="smcap">Mellefont</span> <i>and</i> <span
class="smcap">Cynthia</span>.</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; I heard him loud as I came by the closet-door, and
my lady with him, but she seemed to moderate his passion.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; Ay, hell thank her, as gentle breezes moderate a
fire; but I shall counter-work her spells, and ride the witch in
her own bridle.</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s impossible; she&rsquo;ll cast beyond
you still.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll lay my life it will never be a
match.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; What?</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; Between you and me.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; Why so?</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; My mind gives me it won&rsquo;t, because we are
both willing.&nbsp; We each of us strive to reach the goal, and
hinder one another in the race.&nbsp; I swear it never does well
when the parties are so agreed; for when people walk hand in hand
there&rsquo;s neither overtaking nor meeting.&nbsp; We hunt in
couples, where we both pursue the same game but forget one
another; and &rsquo;tis because we are so near that we
don&rsquo;t think of coming together.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; Hum, &rsquo;gad I believe there&rsquo;s something
in it.&nbsp; Marriage is the game that we hunt, and while we
think that we only have it in view, I don&rsquo;t see but we have
it in our power.</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; Within reach; for example, give me your
hand.&nbsp; You have looked through the wrong end of the
perspective all this while, for nothing has been between us but
our fears.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know why we should not steal out of
the house this very moment and marry one another, without
consideration or the fear of repentance.&nbsp; Pox o&rsquo;
fortune, portion, settlements, and jointures.</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; Ay, ay, what have we to do with &rsquo;em?&nbsp;
You know we marry for love.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; Love, love, downright, very villainous love.</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; And he that can&rsquo;t live upon love deserves to
die in a ditch.&nbsp; Here then, I give you my promise, in spite
of duty, any temptation of wealth, your inconstancy, or my own
inclination to change&mdash;</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; To run most wilfully and unreasonably away with me
this moment and be married.</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; Hold.&nbsp; Never to marry anybody else.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s but a kind of negative consent.&nbsp;
Why, you won&rsquo;t baulk the frolic?</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; If you had not been so assured of your own conduct
I would not.&nbsp; But &rsquo;tis but reasonable that since I
consent to like a man without the vile consideration of money, he
should give me a very evident demonstration of his wit: therefore
let me see you undermine my Lady Touchwood, as you boasted, and
force her to give her consent, and then&mdash;</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll do&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; And I&rsquo;ll do&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; This very next ensuing hour of eight o&rsquo;clock
is the last minute of her reign, unless the devil assist her
<i>in propri&acirc; person&acirc;</i>.</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; Well, if the devil should assist her, and your
plot miscarry&mdash;</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; Ay, what am I to trust to then?</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; Why, if you give me very clear demonstration that
it was the devil, I&rsquo;ll allow for irresistible odds.&nbsp;
But if I find it to be only chance, or destiny, or unlucky stars,
or anything but the very devil, I&rsquo;m inexorable: only still
I&rsquo;ll keep my word, and live a maid for your sake.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; And you won&rsquo;t die one, for your own, so still
there&rsquo;s hope.</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s my mother-in-law, and your friend
Careless; I would not have &rsquo;em see us together yet.</p>
<h4>SCENE II.</h4>
<p><span class="smcap">Careless</span> <i>and</i> <span
class="smcap">Lady Plyant</span>.</p>
<p>LADY PLYANT.&nbsp; I swear, Mr. Careless, you are very
alluring, and say so many fine things, and nothing is so moving
to me as a fine thing.&nbsp; Well, I must do you this justice,
and declare in the face of the world, never anybody gained so far
upon me as yourself.&nbsp; With blushes I must own it, you have
shaken, as I may say, the very foundation of my honour.&nbsp;
Well, sure, if I escape your importunities, I shall value myself
as long as I live, I swear.</p>
<p>CARE.&nbsp; And despise me.&nbsp; [<i>Sighing</i>.]</p>
<p>LADY PLYANT.&nbsp; The last of any man in the world, by my
purity; now you make me swear.&nbsp; O gratitude forbid, that I
should ever be wanting in a respectful acknowledgment of an
entire resignation of all my best wishes for the person and parts
of so accomplished a person, whose merit challenges much more,
I&rsquo;m sure, than my illiterate praises can description.</p>
<p>CARE.&nbsp; [<i>In a whining tone</i>.]&nbsp; Ah heavens,
madam, you ruin me with kindness.&nbsp; Your charming tongue
pursues the victory of your eyes, while at your feet your poor
adorer dies.</p>
<p>LADY PLYANT.&nbsp; Ah!&nbsp; Very fine.</p>
<p>CARE.&nbsp; [<i>Still whining</i>.]&nbsp; Ah, why are you so
fair, so bewitching fair?&nbsp; O let me grow to the ground here,
and feast upon that hand; O let me press it to my heart, my
trembling heart: the nimble movement shall instruct your pulse,
and teach it to alarm desire.&nbsp; (Zoons, I&rsquo;m almost at
the end of my cant, if she does not yield quickly.)&nbsp;
[<i>Aside</i>.]</p>
<p>LADY PLYANT.&nbsp; O that&rsquo;s so passionate and fine, I
cannot hear.&nbsp; I am not safe if I stay, and must leave
you.</p>
<p>CARE.&nbsp; And must you leave me!&nbsp; Rather let me
languish out a wretched life, and breath my soul beneath your
feet.&nbsp; (I must say the same thing over again, and
can&rsquo;t help it.)&nbsp; [<i>Aside</i>.]</p>
<p>LADY PLYANT.&nbsp; I swear I&rsquo;m ready to languish
too!&nbsp; O my honour!&nbsp; Whither is it going?&nbsp; I
protest you have given me the palpitation of the heart.</p>
<p>CARE.&nbsp; Can you be so cruel&mdash;</p>
<p>LADY PLYANT.&nbsp; O rise, I beseech you, say no more till you
rise.&nbsp; Why did you kneel so long?&nbsp; I swear I was so
transported, I did not see it.&nbsp; Well, to show you how far
you have gained upon me, I assure you, if Sir Paul should die, of
all mankind there&rsquo;s none I&rsquo;d sooner make my second
choice.</p>
<p>CARE.&nbsp; O Heaven!&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t out-live this night
without your favour; I feel my spirits faint, a general dampness
overspreads my face, a cold deadly dew already vents through all
my pores, and will to-morrow wash me for ever from your sight,
and drown me in my tomb.</p>
<p>LADY PLYANT.&nbsp; Oh, you have conquered, sweet, melting,
moving sir, you have conquered.&nbsp; What heart of marble can
refrain to weep, and yield to such sad sayings!&nbsp;
[<i>Cries</i>.]</p>
<p>CARE.&nbsp; I thank Heaven, they are the saddest that I ever
said.&nbsp; Oh!&nbsp; (I shall never contain laughter.)&nbsp;
[<i>Aside</i>.]</p>
<p>LADY PLYANT.&nbsp; Oh, I yield myself all up to your
uncontrollable embraces.&nbsp; Say, thou dear dying man, when,
where, and how.&nbsp; Ah, there&rsquo;s Sir Paul.</p>
<p>CARE.&nbsp; &rsquo;Slife, yonder&rsquo;s Sir Paul, but if he
were not come, I&rsquo;m so transported I cannot speak.&nbsp;
This note will inform you.&nbsp; [<i>Gives her a note</i>.]</p>
<h4>SCENE III.</h4>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Plyant</span>, <span
class="smcap">Sir Paul</span>, <span
class="smcap">Cynthia</span>.</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; Thou art my tender lambkin, and shalt do what
thou wilt.&nbsp; But endeavour to forget this Mellefont.</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; I would obey you to my power, sir; but if I have
not him, I have sworn never to marry.</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; Never to marry!&nbsp; Heavens forbid! must I
neither have sons nor grandsons?&nbsp; Must the family of the
Plyants be utterly extinct for want of issue male?&nbsp; O
impiety!&nbsp; But did you swear, did that sweet creature swear?
ha!&nbsp; How durst you swear without my consent, ah?&nbsp;
Gads-bud, who am I?</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; Pray don&rsquo;t be angry, sir, when I swore I had
your consent; and therefore I swore.</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; Why then the revoking my consent does annul,
or make of none effect your oath; so you may unswear it
again.&nbsp; The law will allow it.</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; Ay, but my conscience never will.</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; Gads-bud, no matter for that, conscience and
law never go together; you must not expect that.</p>
<p>LADY PLYANT.&nbsp; Ay, but, Sir Paul, I conceive if she has
sworn, d&rsquo;ye mark me, if she has once sworn, it is most
unchristian, inhuman, and obscene that she should break it.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll make up the match again, because Mr. Careless said it
would oblige him.&nbsp; [<i>Aside</i>.]</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; Does your ladyship conceive so?&nbsp; Why, I
was of that opinion once too.&nbsp; Nay, if your ladyship
conceives so, I&rsquo;m of that opinion again; but I can neither
find my lord nor my lady to know what they intend.</p>
<p>LADY PLYANT.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m satisfied that my cousin
Mellefont has been much wronged.</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; [<i>Aside</i>.]&nbsp; I&rsquo;m amazed to find her
of our side, for I&rsquo;m sure she loved him.</p>
<p>LADY PLYANT.&nbsp; I know my Lady Touchwood has no kindness
for him; and besides I have been informed by Mr. Careless, that
Mellefont had never anything more than a profound respect.&nbsp;
That he has owned himself to be my admirer &rsquo;tis true, but
he was never so presumptuous to entertain any dishonourable
notions of things; so that if this be made plain, I don&rsquo;t
see how my daughter can in conscience, or honour, or anything in
the world&mdash;</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; Indeed if this be made plain, as my lady, your
mother, says, child&mdash;</p>
<p>LADY PLYANT.&nbsp; Plain!&nbsp; I was informed of it by Mr.
Careless.&nbsp; And I assure you, Mr. Careless is a person that
has a most extraordinary respect and honour for you, Sir
Paul.</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; [<i>Aside</i>.]&nbsp; And for your ladyship too, I
believe, or else you had not changed sides so soon; now I begin
to find it.</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; I am much obliged to Mr. Careless really; he
is a person that I have a great value for, not only for that, but
because he has a great veneration for your ladyship.</p>
<p>LADY PLYANT.&nbsp; O las, no indeed, Sir Paul, &rsquo;tis upon
your account.</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; No, I protest and vow, I have no title to his
esteem, but in having the honour to appertain in some measure to
your ladyship, that&rsquo;s all.</p>
<p>LADY PLYANT.&nbsp; O law now, I swear and declare it
shan&rsquo;t be so; you&rsquo;re too modest, Sir Paul.</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; It becomes me, when there is any comparison
made between&mdash;</p>
<p>LADY PLYANT.&nbsp; O fie, fie, Sir Paul, you&rsquo;ll put me
out of countenance.&nbsp; Your very obedient and affectionate
wife; that&rsquo;s all.&nbsp; And highly honoured in that
title.</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; Gads-bud, I am transported!&nbsp; Give me
leave to kiss your ladyship&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; That my poor father should be so very silly!&nbsp;
[<i>Aside</i>.]</p>
<p>LADY PLYANT.&nbsp; My lip indeed, Sir Paul, I swear you
shall.&nbsp; [<i>He kisses her</i>, <i>and bows very
low</i>.]</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; I humbly thank your ladyship.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t know whether I fly on ground, or walk in air.&nbsp;
Gads-bud, she was never thus before.&nbsp; Well, I must own
myself the most beholden to Mr. Careless.&nbsp; As sure as can
be, this is all his doing, something that he has said; well,
&rsquo;tis a rare thing to have an ingenious friend.&nbsp; Well,
your ladyship is of opinion that the match may go forward.</p>
<p>LADY PLYANT.&nbsp; By all means.&nbsp; Mr. Careless has
satisfied me of the matter.</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; Well, why then, lamb, you may keep your oath,
but have a care about making rash vows; come hither to me, and
kiss papa.</p>
<p>LADY PLYANT.&nbsp; I swear and declare, I am in such a twitter
to read Mr. Careless his letter, that I can&rsquo;t forbear any
longer.&nbsp; But though I may read all letters first by
prerogative, yet I&rsquo;ll be sure to be unsuspected this time,
Sir Paul.</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; Did your ladyship call?</p>
<p>LADY PLYANT.&nbsp; Nay, not to interrupt you, my dear.&nbsp;
Only lend me your letter, which you had from your steward to-day;
I would look upon the account again, and may be increase your
allowance.</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; There it is, madam, do you want a pen and
ink?&nbsp; [<i>Bows and gives the letter</i>.]</p>
<p>LADY PLYANT.&nbsp; No, no, nothing else, I thank you, Sir
Paul.&nbsp; So, now I can read my own letter under the cover of
his.&nbsp; [<i>Aside</i>.]</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; He?&nbsp; And wilt thou bring a grandson at
nine months end&mdash;he?&nbsp; A brave chopping boy.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll settle a thousand pound a year upon the rogue as soon
as ever he looks me in the face, I will, gads-bud.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m overjoyed to think I have any of my family that will
bring children into the world.&nbsp; For I would fain have some
resemblance of myself in my posterity, he, Thy?&nbsp; Can&rsquo;t
you contrive that affair, girl?&nbsp; Do, gads-bud, think on thy
old father, heh?&nbsp; Make the young rogue as like as you
can.</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m glad to see you so merry, sir.</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; Merry, gads-bud, I&rsquo;m serious; I&rsquo;ll
give thee five hundred pounds for every inch of him that
resembles me; ah, this eye, this left eye!&nbsp; A thousand
pounds for this left eye.&nbsp; This has done execution in its
time, girl; why, thou hast my leer, hussey, just thy
father&rsquo;s leer.&nbsp; Let it be transmitted to the young
rogue by the help of imagination; why, &rsquo;tis the mark of our
family, Thy; our house is distinguished by a languishing eye, as
the house of Austria is by a thick lip.&nbsp; Ah! when I was of
your age, hussey, I would have held fifty to one, I could have
drawn my own picture&mdash;gads-bud I could have done&mdash;not
so much as you, neither; but&mdash;nay, don&rsquo;t blush.</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t blush, sir, for I vow I don&rsquo;t
understand.</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; Pshaw, pshaw, you fib, you baggage, you do
understand, and you shall understand; come, don&rsquo;t be so
nice.&nbsp; Gads-bud, don&rsquo;t learn after your mother-in-law
my lady here.&nbsp; Marry, heaven forbid that you should follow
her example; that would spoil all indeed.&nbsp; Bless us! if you
should take a vagary and make a rash resolution on your wedding
night, to die a maid, as she did; all were ruined, all my hopes
lost.&nbsp; My heart would break, and my estate would be left to
the wide world, he?&nbsp; I hope you are a better Christian than
to think of living a nun, he?&nbsp; Answer me?</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m all obedience, sir, to your
commands.</p>
<p>LADY PLYANT.&nbsp; [<i>Having read the letter</i>.]&nbsp; O
dear Mr. Careless, I swear he writes charmingly, and he looks
charmingly, and he has charmed me, as much as I have charmed him;
and so I&rsquo;ll tell him in the wardrobe when &rsquo;tis
dark.&nbsp; O criminy!&nbsp; I hope Sir Paul has not seen both
letters.&nbsp; [<i>Puts the wrong letter hastily up</i>, <i>and
gives him her own</i>.]&nbsp; Sir Paul, here&rsquo;s your letter;
to-morrow morning I&rsquo;ll settle accounts to your
advantage.</p>
<h4>SCENE IV.</h4>
<p>[<i>To them</i>] <span class="smcap">Brisk</span>.</p>
<p>BRISK.&nbsp; Sir Paul, gads-bud, you&rsquo;re an uncivil
person, let me tell you, and all that; and I did not think it had
been in you.</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; O law, what&rsquo;s the matter now?&nbsp; I
hope you are not angry, Mr. Brisk.</p>
<p>BRISK.&nbsp; Deuce take me, I believe you intend to marry your
daughter yourself; you&rsquo;re always brooding over her like an
old hen, as if she were not well hatched, egad, he.</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; Good strange!&nbsp; Mr. Brisk is such a merry
facetious person, he, he, he.&nbsp; No, no, I have done with her,
I have done with her now.</p>
<p>BRISK.&nbsp; The fiddles have stayed this hour in the hall,
and my Lord Froth wants a partner, we can never begin without
her.</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; Go, go child, go, get you gone and dance and
be merry; I&rsquo;ll come and look at you by and by.&nbsp;
Where&rsquo;s my son Mellefont?</p>
<p>LADY PLYANT.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll send him to them, I know where
he is.</p>
<p>BRISK.&nbsp; Sir Paul, will you send Careless into the hall if
you meet him?</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; I will, I will, I&rsquo;ll go and look for him
on purpose.</p>
<h4>SCENE V.</h4>
<p><span class="smcap">Brisk</span> <i>alone</i>.</p>
<p>BRISK.&nbsp; So now they are all gone, and I have an
opportunity to practice.&nbsp; Ah!&nbsp; My dear Lady Froth,
she&rsquo;s a most engaging creature, if she were not so fond of
that damned coxcombly lord of hers; and yet I am forced to allow
him wit too, to keep in with him.&nbsp; No matter, she&rsquo;s a
woman of parts, and, egad, parts will carry her.&nbsp; She said
she would follow me into the gallery.&nbsp; Now to make my
approaches.&nbsp; Hem, hem!&nbsp; Ah ma- [<i>bows</i>.]
dam!&nbsp; Pox on&rsquo;t, why should I disparage my parts by
thinking what to say?&nbsp; None but dull rogues think; witty
men, like rich fellows, are always ready for all expenses; while
your blockheads, like poor needy scoundrels, are forced to
examine their stock, and forecast the charges of the day.&nbsp;
Here she comes, I&rsquo;ll seem not to see her, and try to win
her with a new airy invention of my own, hem!</p>

matter?</p>
<p>BRISK.&nbsp; My Lady Froth!&nbsp; Your ladyship&rsquo;s most
humble servant.&nbsp; The matter, madam?&nbsp; Nothing, madam,
nothing at all, egad.&nbsp; I was fallen into the most agreeable
amusement in the whole province of contemplation: that&rsquo;s
all&mdash;(I&rsquo;ll seem to conceal my passion, and that will
look like respect.)&nbsp; [<i>Aside</i>.]</p>
<p>LADY FROTH.&nbsp; Bless me, why did you call out upon me so
loud?</p>
<p>BRISK.&nbsp; O Lord, I, madam!&nbsp; I beseech your
ladyship&mdash;when?</p>
<p>LADY FROTH.&nbsp; Just now as I came in, bless me, why,
don&rsquo;t you know it?</p>
<p>BRISK.&nbsp; Not I, let me perish.&nbsp; But did I?&nbsp;
Strange!&nbsp; I confess your ladyship was in my thoughts; and I
was in a sort of dream that did in a manner represent a very
pleasing object to my imagination, but&mdash;but did I
indeed?&mdash;To see how love and murder will out.&nbsp; But did
I really name my Lady Froth?</p>
<p>LADY FROTH.&nbsp; Three times aloud, as I love letters.&nbsp;
But did you talk of love?&nbsp; O Parnassus!&nbsp; Who would have
thought Mr. Brisk could have been in love, ha, ha, ha.&nbsp; O
heavens, I thought you could have no mistress but the Nine
Muses.</p>
<p>BRISK.&nbsp; No more I have, egad, for I adore &rsquo;em all

to be splenetic, or airy upon&rsquo;t; the deuce take me if I can

discovery.</p>

Volscius in love!&nbsp; Ha, ha, ha.</p>
<p>BRISK.&nbsp; O barbarous, to turn me into ridicule!&nbsp; Yet,
ha, ha, ha.&nbsp; The deuce take me, I can&rsquo;t help laughing
myself, ha, ha, ha; yet by heavens, I have a violent passion for
your ladyship, seriously.</p>

<p>LADY FROTH.&nbsp; With all my heart.</p>
<p>BRISK.&nbsp; Come, my lord, I&rsquo;ll wait on you.&nbsp; My
charming witty angel!&nbsp; [<i>To her</i>.]</p>
<p>LADY FROTH.&nbsp; We shall have whispering time enough, you
know, since we are partners.</p>
<h4>SCENE VIII.</h4>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Plyant</span> <i>and</i> <span
class="smcap">Careless</span>.</p>
<p>LADY PLYANT.&nbsp; Oh, Mr. Careless, Mr. Careless, I&rsquo;m
ruined, I&rsquo;m undone.</p>
<p>CARE.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s the matter, madam?</p>
<p>LADY PLYANT.&nbsp; Oh, the unluckiest accident, I&rsquo;m
afraid I shan&rsquo;t live to tell it you.</p>
<p>CARE.&nbsp; Heaven forbid!&nbsp; What is it?</p>
<p>LADY PLYANT.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m in such a fright; the strangest
quandary and premunire!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m all over in a universal
agitation; I dare swear every circumstance of me trembles.&nbsp;
O your letter, your letter!&nbsp; By an unfortunate mistake I
have given Sir Paul your letter instead of his own.</p>
<p>CARE.&nbsp; That was unlucky.</p>
<p>LADY PLYANT.&nbsp; Oh, yonder he comes reading of it; for
heaven&rsquo;s sake step in here and advise me quickly before he
sees.</p>
<h4>SCENE IX.</h4>
<p><span class="smcap">Sir Paul</span> <i>with the
Letter</i>.</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; O Providence, what a conspiracy have I
discovered.&nbsp; But let me see to make an end on&rsquo;t.&nbsp;
[<i>Reads</i>.]&nbsp; Hum&mdash;After supper in the wardrobe by
the gallery.&nbsp; If Sir Paul should surprise us, I have a
commission from him to treat with you about the very matter of
fact.&nbsp; Matter of fact!&nbsp; Very pretty; it seems that I am
conducting to my own cuckoldom.&nbsp; Why, this is the very
traitorous position of taking up arms by my authority, against my
person!&nbsp; Well, let me see.&nbsp; Till then I languish in
expectation of my adored charmer.&mdash;Dying Ned Careless.&nbsp;
Gads-bud, would that were matter of fact too.&nbsp; Die and be
damned for a Judas Maccabeus and Iscariot both.&nbsp; O
friendship! what art thou but a name?&nbsp; Henceforward let no
man make a friend that would not be a cuckold: for whomsoever he
receives into his bosom will find the way to his bed, and there
return his caresses with interest to his wife.&nbsp; Have I for
this been pinioned, night after night for three years past?&nbsp;
Have I been swathed in blankets till I have been even deprived of
motion?&nbsp; Have I approached the marriage bed with reverence
as to a sacred shrine, and denied myself the enjoyment of lawful
domestic pleasures to preserve its purity, and must I now find it
polluted by foreign iniquity?&nbsp; O my Lady Plyant, you were
chaste as ice, but you are melted now, and false as water.&nbsp;
But Providence has been constant to me in discovering this
conspiracy; still, I am beholden to Providence.&nbsp; If it were
not for Providence, sure, poor Sir Paul, thy heart would
break.</p>
<h4>SCENE X.</h4>
<p>[<i>To him</i>] <span class="smcap">Lady Plyant</span>.</p>
<p>LADY PLYANT.&nbsp; So, sir, I see you have read the
letter.&nbsp; Well, now, Sir Paul, what do you think of your
friend Careless?&nbsp; Has he been treacherous, or did you give
his insolence a licence to make trial of your wife&rsquo;s
suspected virtue?&nbsp; D&rsquo;ye see here?&nbsp; [<i>Snatches
the letter as in anger</i>.]&nbsp; Look, read it.&nbsp; Gads my
life, if I thought it were so, I would this moment renounce all
communication with you.&nbsp; Ungrateful monster!&nbsp; He? is it
so?&nbsp; Ay, I see it, a plot upon my honour; your guilty cheeks
confess it.&nbsp; Oh, where shall wronged virtue fly for
reparation?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll be divorced this instant.</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; Gads-bud, what shall I say?&nbsp; This is the
strangest surprise.&nbsp; Why, I don&rsquo;t know anything at
all, nor I don&rsquo;t know whether there be anything at all in
the world, or no.</p>
<p>LADY PLYANT.&nbsp; I thought I should try you, false
man.&nbsp; I, that never dissembled in my life, yet to make trial
of you, pretended to like that monster of iniquity, Careless, and
found out that contrivance to let you see this letter, which now
I find was of your own inditing&mdash;I do, heathen, I do.&nbsp;
See my face no more; I&rsquo;ll be divorced presently.</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; O strange, what will become of me?&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m so amazed, and so overjoyed, so afraid, and so
sorry.&nbsp; But did you give me this letter on purpose,
he?&nbsp; Did you?</p>
<p>LADY PLYANT.&nbsp; Did I?&nbsp; Do you doubt me, Turk,
Saracen?&nbsp; I have a cousin that&rsquo;s a proctor in the
Commons; I&rsquo;ll go to him instantly.</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; Hold, stay, I beseech your ladyship.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m so overjoyed, stay, I&rsquo;ll confess all.</p>
<p>LADY PLYANT.&nbsp; What will you confess, Jew?</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; Why, now, as I hope to be saved, I had no hand
in this letter&mdash;nay, hear me, I beseech your ladyship.&nbsp;
The devil take me now if he did not go beyond my
commission.&nbsp; If I desired him to do any more than speak a
good word only just for me; gads-bud, only for poor Sir Paul,
I&rsquo;m an Anabaptist, or a Jew, or what you please to call
me.</p>
<p>LADY PLYANT.&nbsp; Why, is not here matter of fact?</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; Ay, but by your own virtue and continency that
matter of fact is all his own doing.&nbsp; I confess I had a
great desire to have some honours conferred upon me, which lie
all in your ladyship&rsquo;s breast, and he being a well-spoken
man, I desired him to intercede for me.</p>
<p>LADY PLYANT.&nbsp; Did you so? presumption!&nbsp; Oh, he
comes, the Tarquin comes; I cannot bear his sight.</p>
<h4>SCENE XI.</h4>
<p><span class="smcap">Careless</span>, <span class="smcap">Sir
Paul</span>.</p>
<p>CARE.&nbsp; Sir Paul, I&rsquo;m glad I&rsquo;ve met with you,
&rsquo;gad, I have said all I could, but can&rsquo;t
prevail.&nbsp; Then my friendship to you has carried me a little
farther in this matter.</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; Indeed; well sir, I&rsquo;ll dissemble with
him a little.&nbsp; [<i>Aside</i>.]</p>
<p>CARE.&nbsp; Why, faith I have in my time known honest
gentlemen abused by a pretended coyness in their wives, and I had
a mind to try my lady&rsquo;s virtue.&nbsp; And when I could not
prevail for you, gad, I pretended to be in love myself; but all
in vain, she would not hear a word upon that subject.&nbsp; Then
I writ a letter to her; I don&rsquo;t know what effects that will
have, but I&rsquo;ll be sure to tell you when I do, though by
this light I believe her virtue is impregnable.</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; O Providence!&nbsp; Providence!&nbsp; What
discoveries are here made?&nbsp; Why, this is better and more
miraculous than the rest.</p>
<p>CARE.&nbsp; What do you mean?</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t tell you, I&rsquo;m so
overjoyed; come along with me to my lady, I can&rsquo;t contain
myself; come, my dear friend.</p>
<p>CARE.&nbsp; So, so, so, this difficulty&rsquo;s over.&nbsp;
[<i>Aside</i>.]</p>
<h4>SCENE XII.</h4>
<p><span class="smcap">Mellefont</span>, <span
class="smcap">Maskwell</span>, <i>from different doors</i>.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; Maskwell!&nbsp; I have been looking for
you&mdash;&rsquo;tis within a quarter of eight.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; My lady is just gone into my lord&rsquo;s closet,
you had best steal into her chamber before she comes, and lie
concealed there, otherwise she may lock the door when we are
together, and you not easily get in to surprise us.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; He?&nbsp; You say true.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; You had best make haste, for after she has made
some apology to the company for her own and my lord&rsquo;s
absence all this while, she&rsquo;ll retire to her chamber
instantly.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; I go this moment.&nbsp; Now, fortune, I defy
thee.</p>
<h4>SCENE XIII.</h4>
<p><span class="smcap">Maskwell</span> <i>alone</i>.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; I confess you may be allowed to be secure in your
own opinion; the appearance is very fair, but I have an
after-game to play that shall turn the tables, and here comes the
man that I must manage.</p>
<h4>SCENE XIV.</h4>
<p>[<i>To him</i>] <span class="smcap">Lord Touchwood</span>.</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; Maskwell, you are the man I wished to
meet.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; I am happy to be in the way of your
lordship&rsquo;s commands.</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; I have always found you prudent and careful
in anything that has concerned me or my family.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; I were a villain else.&nbsp; I am bound by duty
and gratitude, and my own inclination, to be ever your
lordship&rsquo;s servant.</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; Enough.&nbsp; You are my friend; I know
it.&nbsp; Yet there has been a thing in your knowledge, which has
concerned me nearly, that you have concealed from me.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; My lord!</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; Nay, I excuse your friendship to my
unnatural nephew thus far.&nbsp; But I know you have been privy
to his impious designs upon my wife.&nbsp; This evening she has
told me all.&nbsp; Her good nature concealed it as long as was
possible; but he perseveres so in villainy, that she has told me
even you were weary of dissuading him, though you have once
actually hindered him from forcing her.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; I am sorry, my lord, I can&rsquo;t make you an
answer; this is an occasion in which I would not willing be
silent.</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; I know you would excuse him&mdash;and I know
as well that you can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; Indeed I was in hopes it had been a youthful heat
that might have soon boiled over; but&mdash;</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; Say on.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; I have nothing more to say, my lord; but to
express my concern; for I think his frenzy increases daily.</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; How!&nbsp; Give me but proof of it, ocular
proof, that I may justify my dealing with him to the world, and
share my fortunes.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; O my lord! consider; that is hard.&nbsp; Besides,
time may work upon him.&nbsp; Then, for me to do it!&nbsp; I have
professed an everlasting friendship to him.</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; He is your friend; and what am I?</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; I am answered.</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; Fear not his displeasure; I will put you out
of his, and fortune&rsquo;s power, and for that thou art
scrupulously honest, I will secure thy fidelity to him, and give
my honour never to own any discovery that you shall make
me.&nbsp; Can you give me a demonstrative proof?&nbsp; Speak.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; I wish I could not.&nbsp; To be plain, my lord, I
intended this evening to have tried all arguments to dissuade him
from a design which I suspect; and if I had not succeeded, to
have informed your lordship of what I knew.</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; I thank you.&nbsp; What is the
villain&rsquo;s purpose?</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; He has owned nothing to me of late, and what I
mean now, is only a bare suspicion of my own.&nbsp; If your
lordship will meet me a quarter of an hour hence there, in that
lobby by my lady&rsquo;s bed-chamber, I shall be able to tell you
more.</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; I will.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; My duty to your lordship makes me do a severe
piece of justice.</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; I will be secret, and reward your honesty
beyond your hopes.</p>

<p><i>Scene opening</i>, <i>shows Lady Touchwood&rsquo;s

<p>MEL.&nbsp; Pray heaven my aunt keep touch with her
assignation.&nbsp; O that her lord were but sweating behind this
hanging, with the expectation of what I shall see.&nbsp; Hist,
she comes.&nbsp; Little does she think what a mine is just ready
to spring under her feet.&nbsp; But to my post.&nbsp; [<i>Goes
behind the hangings</i>.]</p>
<h4>SCENE XVI.</h4>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Touchwood</span>.</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis eight o&rsquo;clock; methinks I
should have found him here.&nbsp; Who does not prevent the hour
of love, outstays the time; for to be dully punctual is too
slow.&nbsp; I was accusing you of neglect.</p>
<h4>SCENE XVII.</h4>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Touchwood</span>, <span
class="smcap">Maskwell</span>, <span
class="smcap">Mellefont</span> <i>absconding</i>.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; I confess you do reproach me when I see you here
before me; but &rsquo;tis fit I should be still behindhand, still
to be more and more indebted to your goodness.</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; You can excuse a fault too well, not to have
been to blame.&nbsp; A ready answer shows you were prepared.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; Guilt is ever at a loss, and confusion waits upon
it; when innocence and bold truth are always ready for
expression.</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; Not in love: words are the weak support of
cold indifference; love has no language to be heard.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; Excess of joy has made me stupid!&nbsp; Thus may
my lips be ever closed.&nbsp; [<i>Kisses her</i>.]&nbsp; And
thus&mdash;O who would not lose his speech, upon condition to
have joys above it?</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; Hold, let me lock the door first.&nbsp;
[<i>Goes to the door</i>.]</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; [<i>Aside</i>.]&nbsp; That I believed; &rsquo;twas
well I left the private passage open.</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; So, that&rsquo;s safe.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; And so may all your pleasures be, and secret as
this kiss&mdash;</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; And may all treachery be thus discovered.&nbsp;
[<i>Leaps out</i>.]</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; Ah!&nbsp; [<i>Shrieks</i>.]</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; Villain!&nbsp; [<i>Offers to draw</i>.]</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; Nay, then, there&rsquo;s but one way.&nbsp;
[<i>Runs out</i>.]</p>
<h4>SCENE XVIII.</h4>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Touchwood</span>, <span
class="smcap">Mellefont</span>.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; Say you so, were you provided for an escape?&nbsp;
Hold, madam, you have no more holes to your burrow; I&rsquo;ll
stand between you and this sally-port.</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; Thunder strike thee dead for this deceit,
immediate lightning blast thee, me, and the whole world!&nbsp;
Oh!&nbsp; I could rack myself, play the vulture to my own heart,
and gnaw it piecemeal, for not boding to me this misfortune.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; Be patient.</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; Be damned.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; Consider, I have you on the hook; you will but
flounder yourself a-weary, and be nevertheless my prisoner.</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll hold my breath and die, but
I&rsquo;ll be free.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; O madam, have a care of dying unprepared, I doubt
you have some unrepented sins that may hang heavy, and retard
your flight.</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; O! what shall I do? say?&nbsp; Whither shall
I turn?&nbsp; Has hell no remedy?</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; None; hell has served you even as heaven has done,
left you to yourself.&mdash;You&rsquo;re in a kind of Erasmus
paradise, yet if you please you may make it a purgatory; and with
a little penance and my absolution all this may turn to good
account.</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; [<i>Aside</i>.]&nbsp; Hold in my passion,
and fall, fall a little, thou swelling heart; let me have some
intermission of this rage, and one minute&rsquo;s coolness to
dissemble.&nbsp; [<i>She weeps</i>.]</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; You have been to blame.&nbsp; I like those tears,
and hope they are of the purest kind,&mdash;penitential
tears.</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; O the scene was shifted quick before
me,&mdash;I had not time to think.&nbsp; I was surprised to see a
monster in the glass, and now I find &rsquo;tis myself; can you
have mercy to forgive the faults I have imagined, but never put
in practice?&mdash;O consider, consider how fatal you have been
to me, you have already killed the quiet of this life.&nbsp; The
love of you was the first wandering fire that e&rsquo;er misled
my steps, and while I had only that in view, I was betrayed into
unthought of ways of ruin.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; May I believe this true?</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; O be not cruelly incredulous.&mdash;How can
you doubt these streaming eyes?&nbsp; Keep the severest eye
o&rsquo;er all my future conduct, and if I once relapse, let me
not hope forgiveness; &rsquo;twill ever be in your power to ruin
me.&nbsp; My lord shall sign to your desires; I will myself
create your happiness, and Cynthia shall be this night your
bride.&nbsp; Do but conceal my failings, and forgive.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; Upon such terms I will be ever yours in every
honest way.</p>

I&rsquo;ll forgive all that&rsquo;s past.&nbsp; O heaven, you

<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; O heavens, my lord!&nbsp; Hold, hold, for
heaven&rsquo;s sake.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; Confusion, my uncle!&nbsp; O the damned
sorceress.</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; Moderate your rage, good my lord!&nbsp;
He&rsquo;s mad, alas, he&rsquo;s mad.&nbsp; Indeed he is, my
lord, and knows not what he does.&nbsp; See how wild he
looks.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; By heaven, &rsquo;twere senseless not to be mad,
and see such witchcraft.</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; My lord, you hear him, he talks idly.</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; Hence from my sight, thou living infamy to
my name; when next I see that face, I&rsquo;ll write villain
in&rsquo;t with my sword&rsquo;s point.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; Now, by my soul, I will not go till I have made
known my wrongs.&nbsp; Nay, till I have made known yours, which,
if possible, are greater,&mdash;though she has all the host of
hell her servants.</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; Alas, he raves!&nbsp; Talks very
poetry!&nbsp; For heaven&rsquo;s sake away, my lord, he&rsquo;ll
either tempt you to extravagance, or commit some himself.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; Death and furies, will you not hear me?&mdash;Why
by heaven she laughs, grins, points to your back; she forks out
cuckoldom with her fingers, and you&rsquo;re running horn-mad
after your fortune.&nbsp; [<i>As she is going she turns back and
smiles at him</i>.]</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; I fear he&rsquo;s mad
indeed.&mdash;Let&rsquo;s send Maskwell to him.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; Send him to her.</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; Come, come, good my lord, my heart aches so,
I shall faint if I stay.</p>
<h4>SCENE XXI.</h4>

<p>MEL.&nbsp; Oh, I could curse my stars, fate, and chance; all
causes and accidents of fortune in this life!&nbsp; But to what
purpose?&nbsp; Yet, &rsquo;sdeath, for a man to have the fruit of
all his industry grow full and ripe, ready to drop into his
mouth, and just when he holds out his hand to gather it, to have
a sudden whirlwind come, tear up tree and all, and bear away the
very root and foundation of his hopes:&mdash;what temper can
contain?&nbsp; They talk of sending Maskwell to me; I never had
more need of him.&nbsp; But what can he do?&nbsp; Imagination
cannot form a fairer and more plausible design than this of his
which has miscarried.&nbsp; O my precious aunt, I shall never
thrive without I deal with the devil, or another woman.</p>
<p>Women, like flames, have a destroying power,</p>

<h4>SCENE I.</h4>

<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; Was&rsquo;t not lucky?</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; Lucky!&nbsp; Fortune is your own, and &rsquo;tis
her interest so to be.&nbsp; By heaven I believe you can control
her power, and she fears it: though chance brought my lord,
&rsquo;twas your own art that turned it to advantage.</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis true it might have been my
ruin.&nbsp; But yonder&rsquo;s my lord.&nbsp; I believe
he&rsquo;s coming to find you: I&rsquo;ll not be seen.</p>
<h4>SCENE II.</h4>
<p><span class="smcap">Maskwell</span> <i>alone</i>.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; So; I durst not own my introducing my lord, though
it succeeded well for her, for she would have suspected a design
which I should have been puzzled to excuse.&nbsp; My lord is
thoughtful.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll be so too; yet he shall know my
thoughts: or think he does.</p>
<h4>SCENE III.</h4>
<p>[<i>To him</i>] <span class="smcap">Lord Touchwood</span>.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; What have I done?</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; Talking to himself!</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas honest&mdash;and shall I be rewarded
for it?&nbsp; No, &rsquo;twas honest, therefore I
shan&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Nay, rather therefore I ought not; for it
rewards itself.</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; Unequalled virtue!&nbsp; [<i>Aside</i>.]</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; But should it be known, then I have lost a
friend!&nbsp; He was an ill man, and I have gained; for half
myself I lent him, and that I have recalled: so I have served
myself, and what is yet better, I have served a worthy lord to
whom I owe myself.</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; Excellent man!&nbsp; [<i>Aside</i>.]</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; Yet I am wretched.&nbsp; Oh, there is a secret
burns within this breast, which, should it once blaze forth,
would ruin all, consume my honest character, and brand me with
the name of villain.</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; Ha!</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; Why do I love!&nbsp; Yet heaven and my waking
conscience are my witnesses, I never gave one working thought a
vent, which might discover that I loved, nor ever must.&nbsp; No,
let it prey upon my heart; for I would rather die, than seem
once, barely seem, dishonest.&nbsp; Oh, should it once be known I
love fair Cynthia, all this that I have done would look like
rival&rsquo;s malice, false friendship to my lord, and base
self-interest.&nbsp; Let me perish first, and from this hour
avoid all sight and speech, and, if I can, all thought of that
pernicious beauty.&nbsp; Ha!&nbsp; But what is my distraction
doing?&nbsp; I am wildly talking to myself, and some ill chance
might have directed malicious ears this way.&nbsp; [<i>Seems to
start</i>, <i>seeing my lord</i>.]</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; Start not; let guilty and dishonest souls
start at the revelation of their thoughts, but be thou fixed, as
is thy virtue.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; I am confounded, and beg your Lordship&rsquo;s
pardon for those free discourses which I have had with
myself.</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; Come, I beg your pardon that I overheard
you, and yet it shall not need.&nbsp; Honest Maskwell!&nbsp; Thy
and my good genius led me hither.&nbsp; Mine, in that I have
discovered so much manly virtue; thine, in that thou shalt have
due reward of all thy worth.&nbsp; Give me thy hand.&nbsp; My
nephew is the alone remaining branch of all our ancient family:
him I thus blow away, and constitute thee in his room to be my
heir&mdash;</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; Now heaven forbid&mdash;</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; No more&mdash;I have resolved.&nbsp; The
writings are ready drawn, and wanted nothing but to be signed,
and have his name inserted.&nbsp; Yours will fill the blank as
well.&nbsp; I will have no reply.&nbsp; Let me command this time;
for &rsquo;tis the last in which I will assume authority.&nbsp;
Hereafter, you shall rule where I have power.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; I humbly would petition&mdash;</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; Is&rsquo;t for yourself?&nbsp; [<span
class="smcap">Maskwell</span> <i>pauses</i>.]&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll
hear of nought for anybody else.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; Then witness heaven for me, this wealth and honour
was not of my seeking, nor would I build my fortune on
another&rsquo;s ruin.&nbsp; I had but one desire&mdash;</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; Thou shalt enjoy it.&nbsp; If all I&rsquo;m
worth in wealth or interest can purchase Cynthia, she is
thine.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure Sir Paul&rsquo;s consent will follow
fortune.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll quickly show him which way that is
going.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; You oppress me with bounty.&nbsp; My gratitude is
weak, and shrinks beneath the weight, and cannot rise to thank
you.&nbsp; What, enjoy my love!&nbsp; Forgive the transports of a
blessing so unexpected, so unhoped for, so unthought of!</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; I will confirm it, and rejoice with
thee.</p>
<h4>SCENE IV.</h4>
<p><span class="smcap">Maskwell</span> <i>alone</i>.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; This is prosperous indeed.&nbsp; Why let him find
me out a villain, settled in possession of a fair estate, and
full fruition of my love, I&rsquo;ll bear the railings of a
losing gamester.&nbsp; But should he find me out before!&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis dangerous to delay.&nbsp; Let me think.&nbsp; Should
my lord proceed to treat openly of my marriage with Cynthia, all
must be discovered, and Mellefont can be no longer blinded.&nbsp;
It must not be; nay, should my lady know it&mdash;ay, then were
fine work indeed!&nbsp; Her fury would spare nothing, though she
involved herself in ruin.&nbsp; No, it must be by
stratagem.&nbsp; I must deceive Mellefont once more, and get my
lord to consent to my private management.&nbsp; He comes
opportunely.&nbsp; Now will I, in my old way, discover the whole
and real truth of the matter to him, that he may not suspect one
word on&rsquo;t.</p>
<blockquote><p>No mask like open truth to cover lies,<br />
As to go naked is the best disguise.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>SCENE V.</h4>
<p>[<i>To him</i>] <span class="smcap">Mellefont</span>.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; O Maskwell, what hopes?&nbsp; I am confounded in a
maze of thoughts, each leading into one another, and all ending
in perplexity.&nbsp; My uncle will not see nor hear me.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; No matter, sir, don&rsquo;t trouble your head:
all&rsquo;s in my power.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; How?&nbsp; For heaven&rsquo;s sake?</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; Little do you think that your aunt has kept her
word.&nbsp; How the devil she wrought my lord into this dotage, I
know not; but he&rsquo;s gone to Sir Paul about my marriage with
Cynthia, and has appointed me his heir.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; The devil he has!&nbsp; What&rsquo;s to be
done?</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; I have it, it must be by stratagem; for it&rsquo;s
in vain to make application to him.&nbsp; I think I have that in
my head that cannot fail.&nbsp; Where&rsquo;s Cynthia?</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; In the garden.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; Let us go and consult her: my life for yours, I
cheat my lord.</p>
<h4>SCENE VI.</h4>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Touchwood</span>, <span
class="smcap">Lady Touchwood</span>.</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; Maskwell your heir, and marry Cynthia!</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; I cannot do too much for so much merit.</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; But this is a thing of too great moment to
be so suddenly resolved.&nbsp; Why Cynthia?&nbsp; Why must he be
married?&nbsp; Is there not reward enough in raising his low
fortune, but he must mix his blood with mine, and wed my
niece?&nbsp; How know you that my brother will consent, or
she?&nbsp; Nay, he himself perhaps may have affections
otherwhere.</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; No, I am convinced he loves her.</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; Maskwell love Cynthia?&nbsp; Impossible!</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; I tell you he confessed it to me.</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; Confusion!&nbsp; How&rsquo;s this?&nbsp;
[<i>Aside</i>.]</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; His humility long stifled his passion.&nbsp;
And his love of Mellefont would have made him still conceal
it.&nbsp; But by encouragement, I wrung the secret from him, and
know he&rsquo;s no way to be rewarded but in her.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll defer my farther proceedings in it till you have
considered it; but remember how we are both indebted to him.</p>
<h4>SCENE VII.</h4>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Touchwood</span> <i>alone</i>.</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; Both indebted to him!&nbsp; Yes, we are both
indebted to him, if you knew all.&nbsp; Villain!&nbsp; Oh, I am
wild with this surprise of treachery: it is impossible, it cannot
be.&nbsp; He love Cynthia!&nbsp; What, have I been bawd to his
designs, his property only, a baiting place?&nbsp; Now I see what
made him false to Mellefont.&nbsp; Shame and distraction!&nbsp; I
cannot bear it, oh! what woman can bear to be a property?&nbsp;
To be kindled to a flame, only to light him to another&rsquo;s
arms; oh! that I were fire indeed that I might burn the vile
traitor.&nbsp; What shall I do?&nbsp; How shall I think?&nbsp; I
cannot think.&nbsp; All my designs are lost, my love unsated, my
revenge unfinished, and fresh cause of fury from unthought of
plagues.</p>
<h4>SCENE VIII.</h4>
<p>[<i>To her</i>] <span class="smcap">Sir Paul</span>.</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; Madam, sister, my lady sister, did you see my
lady my wife?</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; Oh!&nbsp; Torture!</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; Gads-bud, I can&rsquo;t find her high nor low;
where can she be, think you?</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; Where she&rsquo;s serving you, as all your
sex ought to be served, making you a beast.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you
know you&rsquo;re a fool, brother?</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; A fool; he, he, he, you&rsquo;re merry.&nbsp;
No, no, not I, I know no such matter.</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; Why, then, you don&rsquo;t know half your
happiness.</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s a jest with all my heart, faith
and troth.&nbsp; But harkee, my lord told me something of a
revolution of things; I don&rsquo;t know what to make
on&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Gads-bud, I must consult my wife:&mdash;he
talks of disinheriting his nephew, and I don&rsquo;t know
what.&nbsp; Look you, sister, I must know what my girl has to
trust to, or not a syllable of a wedding, gads-bud!&mdash;to show
you that I am not a fool.</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; Hear me: consent to the breaking off this
marriage, and the promoting any other without consulting me, and
I&rsquo;ll renounce all blood, all relation and concern with you
for ever; nay, I&rsquo;ll be your enemy, and pursue you to
destruction: I&rsquo;ll tear your eyes out, and tread you under
my feet.</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; Why, what&rsquo;s the matter now?&nbsp; Good
Lord, what&rsquo;s all this for?&nbsp; Pooh, here&rsquo;s a joke
indeed.&nbsp; Why, where&rsquo;s my wife?</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; With Careless, in the close arbour; he may
want you by this time, as much as you want her.</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; Oh, if she be with Mr. Careless, &rsquo;tis
well enough.</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; Fool, sot, insensible ox!&nbsp; But remember
what I said to you, or you had better eat your own horns, by this
light you had.</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re a passionate woman,
gads-bud!&nbsp; But to say truth all our family are choleric; I
am the only peaceable person amongst &rsquo;em.</p>
<h4>SCENE IX.</h4>
<p><span class="smcap">Mellefont</span>, <span
class="smcap">Maskwell</span>, <i>and</i> <span
class="smcap">Cynthia</span>.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; I know no other way but this he has proposed: if
you have love enough to run the venture.</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know whether I have love enough, but
I find I have obstinacy enough to pursue whatever I have once
resolved; and a true female courage to oppose anything that
resists my will, though &rsquo;twere reason itself.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s right.&nbsp; Well, I&rsquo;ll secure
the writings and run the hazard along with you.</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; But how can the coach and six horses be got ready
without suspicion?</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; Leave it to my care; that shall be so far from
being suspected, that it shall be got ready by my lord&rsquo;s
own order.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; How?</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; Why, I intend to tell my lord the whole matter of
our contrivance; that&rsquo;s my way.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t understand you.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; Why, I&rsquo;ll tell my lord I laid this plot with
you on purpose to betray you; and that which put me upon it, was
the finding it impossible to gain the lady any other way, but in
the hopes of her marrying you.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; So.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; So, why so, while you&rsquo;re busied in making
yourself ready, I&rsquo;ll wheedle her into the coach; and
instead of you, borrow my lord&rsquo;s chaplain, and so run away
with her myself.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; Oh, I conceive you; you&rsquo;ll tell him so.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; Tell him so! ay; why, you don&rsquo;t think I mean
to do so?</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; No, no; ha, ha, I dare swear thou wilt not.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; Therefore, for our farther security, I would have
you disguised like a parson, that if my lord should have
curiosity to peep, he may not discover you in the coach, but
think the cheat is carried on as he would have it.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; Excellent Maskwell!&nbsp; Thou wert certainly meant
for a statesman or a Jesuit; but thou art too honest for one, and
too pious for the other.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; Well, get yourself ready, and meet me in
half-an-hour, yonder in my lady&rsquo;s dressing-room; go by the
back stairs, and so we may slip down without being
observed.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll send the chaplain to you with his
robes: I have made him my own, and ordered him to meet us
to-morrow morning at St. Albans; there we will sum up this
account, to all our satisfactions.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; Should I begin to thank or praise thee, I should
waste the little time we have.</p>
<h4>SCENE X.</h4>
<p><span class="smcap">Cynthia</span>, <span
class="smcap">Maskwell</span>.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; Madam, you will be ready?</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; I will be punctual to the minute.&nbsp;
[<i>Going</i>.]</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; Stay, I have a doubt.&nbsp; Upon second thoughts,
we had better meet in the chaplain&rsquo;s chamber here, the
corner chamber at this end of the gallery, there is a back way
into it, so that you need not come through this door, and a pair
of private stairs leading down to the stables.&nbsp; It will be
more convenient.</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; I am guided by you; but Mellefont will
mistake.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; No, no, I&rsquo;ll after him immediately, and tell
him.</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; I will not fail.</p>
<h4>SCENE XI.</h4>
<p><span class="smcap">Maskwell</span> <i>alone</i>.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; Why, <i>qui vult decipi
decipiatur</i>.&mdash;&rsquo;Tis no fault of mine: I have told
&rsquo;em in plain terms how easy &rsquo;tis for me to cheat
&rsquo;em, and if they will not hear the serpent&rsquo;s hiss,
they must be stung into experience and future caution.&nbsp; Now
to prepare my lord to consent to this.&nbsp; But first I must
instruct my little Levite; there is no plot, public or private,
that can expect to prosper without one of them has a finger
in&rsquo;t: he promised me to be within at this hour,&mdash;Mr.
Saygrace, Mr. Saygrace!&nbsp; [<i>Goes to the chamber door and
knocks</i>.]</p>
<h4>SCENE XII.</h4>
<p><span class="smcap">Maskwell</span>, <span
class="smcap">Saygrace</span>.</p>
<p>SAYGRACE [<i>looking out</i>.]&nbsp; Sweet sir, I will but pen
the last line of an acrostic, and be with you in the twinkling of
an ejaculation, in the pronouncing of an Amen, or before you
can&mdash;</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; Nay, good Mr. Saygrace, do not prolong the time by
describing to me the shortness of your stay; rather if you
please, defer the finishing of your wit, and let us talk about
our business; it shall be tithes in your way.</p>
<p>SAYGRACE.&nbsp; [<i>Enters</i>.]&nbsp; You shall prevail: I
would break off in the middle of a sermon to do you a
pleasure.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; You could not do me a greater,&mdash;except the
business in hand.&nbsp; Have you provided a habit for
Mellefont?</p>
<p>SAYGRACE.&nbsp; I have; they are ready in my chamber, together
with a clean starched band and cuffs.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; Good, let them be carried to him; have you
stitched the gown sleeve, that he may be puzzled, and waste time
in putting it on?</p>
<p>SAYGRACE.&nbsp; I have: the gown will not be indued without
perplexity.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; Meet me in half-an-hour, here in your own
chamber.&nbsp; When Cynthia comes, let there be no light, and do
not speak, that she may not distinguish you from Mellefont.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll urge haste to excuse your silence.</p>
<p>SAYGRACE.&nbsp; You have no more commands?</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; None: your text is short.</p>
<p>SAYGRACE.&nbsp; But pithy: and I will handle it with
discretion.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; It will be the first you have so served.</p>
<h4>SCENE XIII.</h4>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Touchwood</span>, <span
class="smcap">Maskwell</span>.</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; Sure I was born to be controlled by those I
should command.&nbsp; My very slaves will shortly give me rules
how I shall govern them.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; I am concerned to see your lordship
discomposed.</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; Have you seen my wife lately, or disobliged
her?</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; No, my lord.&nbsp; What can this mean?&nbsp;
[<i>Aside</i>.]</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; Then Mellefont has urged somebody to incense
her.&nbsp; Something she has heard of you which carries her
beyond the bounds of patience.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; This I feared.&nbsp; [<i>Aside</i>.]&nbsp; Did not
your lordship tell her of the honours you designed me?</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; Yes.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis that; you know my lady has a high
spirit; she thinks I am unworthy.</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; Unworthy!&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis an ignorant pride
in her to think so.&nbsp; Honesty to me is true nobility.&nbsp;
However, &rsquo;tis my will it shall be so, and that should be
convincing to her as much as reason.&nbsp; By Heaven, I&rsquo;ll
not be wife-ridden; were it possible, it should be done this
night.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; By Heaven, he meets my wishes!&nbsp;
[<i>Aside</i>.]&nbsp; Few things are impossible to willing
minds.</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; Instruct me how this may be done, you shall
see I want no inclination.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; I had laid a small design for to-morrow (as love
will be inventing) which I thought to communicate to your
lordship.&nbsp; But it may be as well done to-night.</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s company.&nbsp; Come this way
and tell me.</p>
<h4>SCENE XIV.</h4>
<p><span class="smcap">Careless</span> <i>and</i> <span
class="smcap">Cynthia</span>.</p>
<p>CARE.&nbsp; Is not that he now gone out with my lord?</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; Yes.</p>
<p>CARE.&nbsp; By heaven, there&rsquo;s treachery.&nbsp; The
confusion that I saw your father in, my Lady Touchwood&rsquo;s
passion, with what imperfectly I overheard between my lord and
her, confirm me in my fears.&nbsp; Where&rsquo;s Mellefont?</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; Here he comes.</p>
<h4>SCENE XV.</h4>
<p>[<i>To them</i>] <span class="smcap">Mellefont</span>.</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; Did Maskwell tell you anything of the
chaplain&rsquo;s chamber?</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; No.&nbsp; My dear, will you get ready?&nbsp; The
things are all in my chamber; I want nothing but the habit.</p>
<p>CARE.&nbsp; You are betrayed, and Maskwell is the villain I
always thought him.</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; When you were gone, he said his mind was changed,
and bid me meet him in the chaplain&rsquo;s room, pretending
immediately to follow you and give you notice.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; How?</p>
<p>CARE.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s Saygrace tripping by with a bundle
under his arm.&nbsp; He cannot be ignorant that Maskwell means to
use his chamber; let&rsquo;s follow and examine him.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis loss of time; I cannot think him
false.</p>
<h4>SCENE XVI.</h4>
<p><span class="smcap">Cynthia</span>, <span class="smcap">Lord
Touchwood</span>.</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; My lord musing!</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; He has a quick invention, if this were
suddenly designed.&nbsp; Yet he says he had prepared my chaplain
already.</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; How&rsquo;s this?&nbsp; Now I fear indeed.</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; Cynthia here!&nbsp; Alone, fair cousin, and
melancholy?</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; Your lordship was thoughtful.</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; My thoughts were on serious business not
worth your hearing.</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; Mine were on treachery concerning you, and may be
worth your hearing.</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; Treachery concerning me?&nbsp; Pray be
plain.&nbsp; Hark!&nbsp; What noise?</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; (within)&nbsp; Will you not hear me?</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; (within)&nbsp; No, monster! traitor!&nbsp;
No.</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; My lady and Maskwell!&nbsp; This may be
lucky.&nbsp; My lord, let me entreat you to stand behind this
screen and listen: perhaps this chance may give you proof of what
you ne&rsquo;er could have believed from my suspicions.</p>
<h4>SCENE XVII.</h4>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Touchwood</span> <i>with a
dagger</i>; <span class="smcap">Maskwell</span>; <span
class="smcap">Cynthia</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Lord
Touchwood</span> <i>abscond</i>, <i>listening</i>.</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; You want but leisure to invent fresh
falsehood, and soothe me to a fond belief of all your fictions:
but I will stab the lie that&rsquo;s forming in your heart, and
save a sin, in pity to your soul.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; Strike then, since you will have it so.</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; Ha!&nbsp; A steady villain to the last.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; Come, why do you dally with me thus?</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; Thy stubborn temper shocks me, and you knew
it would; this is cunning all, and not courage.&nbsp; No; I know
thee well, but thou shalt miss thy aim.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; Ha, ha, ha!</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; Ha!&nbsp; Do you mock my rage?&nbsp; Then
this shall punish your fond, rash contempt.&nbsp; Again
smile!&nbsp; [<i>Goes to strike</i>.]&nbsp; And such a smile as
speaks in ambiguity!&nbsp; Ten thousand meanings lurk in each
corner of that various face.</p>
<p>Oh! that they were written in thy heart,</p>
<p>That I, with this, might lay thee open to my sight!</p>
<p>But then &rsquo;twill be too late to know&mdash;</p>
<p>Thou hast, thou hast found the only way to turn my rage.&nbsp;
Too well thou knowest my jealous soul could never bear
uncertainty.&nbsp; Speak, then, and tell me.&nbsp; Yet are you
silent.&nbsp; Oh, I am wildered in all passions.&nbsp; But thus
my anger melts.&nbsp; [<i>Weeps</i>.]&nbsp; Here, take this
poniard, for my very spirits faint, and I want strength to hold
it; thou hast disarmed my soul.&nbsp; [<i>Gives the
dagger</i>.]</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; Amazement shakes me.&nbsp; Where will this
end?</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; So, &rsquo;tis well&mdash;let your wild fury have
a vent; and when you have temper, tell me.</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; Now, now, now I am calm and can hear
you.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; [<i>Aside</i>.]&nbsp; Thanks, my invention; and
now I have it for you.&nbsp; First, tell me what urged you to
this violence: for your passion broke in such imperfect terms,
that yet I am to learn the cause.</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; My lord himself surprised me with the news
you were to marry Cynthia, that you had owned our love to him,
and his indulgence would assist you to attain your ends.</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; How, my lord?</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; Pray forbear all resentments for a while,
and let us hear the rest.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; I grant you in appearance all is true; I seemed
consenting to my lord&mdash;nay, transported with the
blessing.&nbsp; But could you think that I, who had been happy in
your loved embraces, could e&rsquo;er be fond of an inferior
slavery?</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; Ha!&nbsp; Oh, poison to my ears!&nbsp; What
do I hear?</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; Nay, good my lord, forbear resentment; let us hear
it out.</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; Yes, I will contain, though I could
burst.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; I, that had wantoned in the rich circle of your
world of love, could be confined within the puny province of a
girl?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; Yet though I dote on each last favour more
than all the rest, though I would give a limb for every look you
cheaply throw away on any other object of your love: yet so far I
prize your pleasures o&rsquo;er my own, that all this seeming
plot that I have laid has been to gratify your taste and cheat
the world, to prove a faithful rogue to you.</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; If this were true.&nbsp; But how can it
be?</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; I have so contrived that Mellefont will presently,
in the chaplain&rsquo;s habit, wait for Cynthia in your
dressing-room; but I have put the change upon her, that she may
be other where employed.&nbsp; Do you procure her night-gown, and
with your hoods tied over your face, meet him in her stead.&nbsp;
You may go privately by the back stairs, and, unperceived, there
you may propose to reinstate him in his uncle&rsquo;s favour, if
he&rsquo;ll comply with your desires&mdash;his case is desperate,
and I believe he&rsquo;ll yield to any conditions.&nbsp; If not
here, take this; you may employ it better than in the heart of
one who is nothing when not yours.&nbsp; [<i>Gives the
dagger</i>.]</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; Thou can&rsquo;st deceive everybody.&nbsp;
Nay, thou hast deceived me; but &rsquo;tis as I would wish.&nbsp;
Trusty villain!&nbsp; I could worship thee.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; No more; it wants but a few minutes of the time;
and Mellefont&rsquo;s love will carry him there before his
hour.</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; I go, I fly, incomparable Maskwell!</p>
<h4>SCENE XVIII.</h4>
<p><span class="smcap">Maskwell</span>, <span
class="smcap">Cynthia</span>, <span class="smcap">Lord
Touchwood</span>.</p>
<p>MASK.&nbsp; So, this was a pinch indeed, my invention was upon
the rack, and made discovery of her last plot.&nbsp; I hope
Cynthia and my chaplain will be ready; I&rsquo;ll prepare for the
expedition.</p>
<h4>SCENE XIX.</h4>
<p><span class="smcap">Cynthia</span> <i>and</i> <span
class="smcap">Lord Touchwood</span>.</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; Now, my lord?</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; Astonishment binds up my rage!&nbsp;
Villainy upon villainy!&nbsp; Heavens, what a long track of dark
deceit has this discovered!&nbsp; I am confounded when I look
back, and want a clue to guide me through the various mazes of
unheard-of treachery.&nbsp; My wife!&nbsp; Damnation!&nbsp; My
hell!</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; My lord, have patience, and be sensible how great
our happiness is, that this discovery was not made too late.</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; I thank you, yet it may be still too late,
if we don&rsquo;t presently prevent the execution of their
plots;&mdash;ha, I&rsquo;ll do&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Where&rsquo;s
Mellefont, my poor injured nephew?&nbsp; How shall I make him
ample satisfaction?</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; I dare answer for him.</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; I do him fresh wrong to question his
forgiveness; for I know him to be all goodness.&nbsp; Yet my
wife!&nbsp; Damn her:&mdash;she&rsquo;ll think to meet him in
that dressing-room.&nbsp; Was&rsquo;t not so?&nbsp; And Maskwell
will expect you in the chaplain&rsquo;s chamber.&nbsp; For once,
I&rsquo;ll add my plot too:&mdash;let us haste to find out, and
inform my nephew; and do you, quickly as you can, bring all the
company into this gallery.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll expose the strumpet,
and the villain.</p>
<h4>SCENE XX.</h4>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Froth</span> <i>and</i> <span
class="smcap">Sir Paul</span>.</p>
<p>LORD FROTH.&nbsp; By heavens, I have slept an age.&nbsp; Sir
Paul, what o&rsquo;clock is&rsquo;t?&nbsp; Past eight, on my
conscience; my lady&rsquo;s is the most inviting couch, and a
slumber there is the prettiest amusement!&nbsp; But where&rsquo;s
all the company?</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; The company, gads-bud, I don&rsquo;t know, my
lord, but here&rsquo;s the strangest revolution, all turned topsy
turvy; as I hope for providence.</p>
<p>LORD FROTH.&nbsp; O heavens, what&rsquo;s the matter?&nbsp;
Where&rsquo;s my wife?</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; All turned topsy turvy as sure as a gun.</p>
<p>LORD FROTH.&nbsp; How do you mean?&nbsp; My wife?</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; The strangest posture of affairs!</p>
<p>LORD FROTH.&nbsp; What, my wife?</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; No, no, I mean the family.&nbsp; Your
lady&rsquo;s affairs may be in a very good posture; I saw her go
into the garden with Mr. Brisk.</p>
<p>LORD FROTH.&nbsp; How?&nbsp; Where, when, what to do?</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; I suppose they have been laying their heads
together.</p>
<p>LORD FROTH.&nbsp; How?</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; Nay, only about poetry, I suppose, my lord;
making couplets.</p>
<p>LORD FROTH.&nbsp; Couplets.</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; Oh, here they come.</p>
<h4>SCENE XXI.</h4>
<p>[<i>To them</i>] <span class="smcap">Lady Froth</span>, <span

<p>BRISK.&nbsp; My lord, your humble servant; Sir Paul,
yours,&mdash;the finest night!</p>
<p>LADY FROTH.&nbsp; My dear, Mr. Brisk and I have been
star-gazing, I don&rsquo;t know how long.</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; Does it not tire your ladyship?&nbsp; Are not
you weary with looking up?</p>
<p>LADY FROTH.&nbsp; Oh, no, I love it violently.&nbsp; My dear,
you&rsquo;re melancholy.</p>
<p>LORD FROTH.&nbsp; No, my dear; I&rsquo;m but just awake.</p>
<p>LADY FROTH.&nbsp; Snuff some of my spirit of hartshorn.</p>
<p>LORD FROTH.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve some of my own, thank you,
dear.</p>
<p>LADY FROTH.&nbsp; Well, I swear, Mr. Brisk, you understood
astronomy like an old Egyptian.</p>
<p>BRISK.&nbsp; Not comparably to your ladyship; you are the very
Cynthia of the skies, and queen of stars.</p>
<p>LADY FROTH.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s because I have no light but
what&rsquo;s by reflection from you, who are the sun.</p>
<p>BRISK.&nbsp; Madam, you have eclipsed me quite, let me
perish.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t answer that.</p>
<p>LADY FROTH.&nbsp; No matter.&nbsp; Hark &rsquo;ee, shall you
and I make an almanac together?</p>
<p>BRISK.&nbsp; With all my soul.&nbsp; Your ladyship has made me
the man in&rsquo;t already, I&rsquo;m so full of the wounds which
you have given.</p>
<p>LADY FROTH.&nbsp; O finely taken!&nbsp; I swear now you are
even with me.&nbsp; O Parnassus, you have an infinite deal of
wit.</p>
<p>SIR PAUL.&nbsp; So he has, gads-bud, and so has your
ladyship.</p>

<p>[<i>To them</i>] <span class="smcap">Lady Plyant</span>, <span
class="smcap">Careless</span>, <span

<p>LADY PLYANT.&nbsp; You tell me most surprising things; bless
me, who would ever trust a man?&nbsp; Oh my heart aches for fear
they should be all deceitful alike.</p>
<p>CARE.&nbsp; You need not fear, madam, you have charms to fix
inconstancy itself.</p>
<p>LADY PLYANT.&nbsp; O dear, you make me blush.</p>
<p>LORD FROTH.&nbsp; Come, my dear, shall we take leave of my
lord and lady?</p>
<p>CYNT.&nbsp; They&rsquo;ll wait upon your lordship
presently.</p>
<p>LADY FROTH.&nbsp; Mr. Brisk, my coach shall set you down.</p>
<p>ALL.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s the matter?&nbsp; [<i>A great shriek
from the corner of the stage</i>.]</p>
<h4>SCENE XXIII.</h4>
<p>[<i>To them</i>] <span class="smcap">Lady Touchwood</span>

parson</i>.</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; Oh, I&rsquo;m betrayed.&nbsp; Save me, help
me!</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; Now what evasion, strumpet?</p>
<p>LADY TOUCH.&nbsp; Stand off, let me go.</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; Go, and thy own infamy pursue thee.&nbsp;
You stare as you were all amazed,&mdash;I don&rsquo;t wonder at
it,&mdash;but too soon you&rsquo;ll know mine, and that
woman&rsquo;s shame.</p>

all falsehood.</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; Are you silent, monster?</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; Good heavens!&nbsp; How I believed and loved this
man!&nbsp; Take him hence, for he&rsquo;s a disease to my
sight.</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; Secure that manifold villain.&nbsp;
[<i>Servants seize him</i>.]</p>
<p>CARE.&nbsp; Miracle of ingratitude!</p>
<p>BRISK.&nbsp; This is all very surprising, let me perish.</p>
<p>LADY FROTH.&nbsp; You know I told you Saturn looked a little
more angry than usual.</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll think of punishment at leisure,
but let me hasten to do justice in rewarding virtue and wronged
innocence.&nbsp; Nephew, I hope I have your pardon, and
Cynthia&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>MEL.&nbsp; We are your lordship&rsquo;s creatures.</p>
<p>LORD TOUCH.&nbsp; And be each other&rsquo;s comfort.&nbsp; Let

No sooner born, but the vile parent dies.</p>

<h4>EPILOGUE<br />
Spoken by <span class="smcap">Mrs. Mountford</span>.</h4>
<p>Could poets but foresee how plays would take,<br />
Then they could tell what epilogues to make;<br />
Whether to thank or blame their audience most.<br />
But that late knowledge does much hazard cost:<br />
Till dice are thrown, there&rsquo;s nothing won, nor lost.<br />
So, till the thief has stolen, he cannot know<br />
Whether he shall escape the law, or no.<br />
But poets run much greater hazards far<br />
Than they who stand their trials at the bar.<br />
The law provides a curb for it&rsquo;s own fury,<br />
And suffers judges to direct the jury:<br />
But in this court, what difference does appear!<br />
For every one&rsquo;s both judge and jury here;<br />
Nay, and what&rsquo;s worse, an executioner.<br />
All have a right and title to some part,<br />
Each choosing that in which he has most art.<br />
The dreadful men of learning all confound,<br />
Unless the fable&rsquo;s good, and moral sound.<br />
The vizor-masks, that are in pit and gallery,<br />
Approve, or damn, the repartee and raillery.<br />
The lady critics, who are better read,<br />
Inquire if characters are nicely bred;<br />
If the soft things are penned and spoke with grace;<br />
They judge of action too, and time, and place;<br />
In which we do not doubt but they&rsquo;re discerning,<br />
For that&rsquo;s a kind of assignation learning.<br />
Beaus judge of dress; the witlings judge of songs;<br />
The cuckoldom, of ancient right, to cits belongs.<br />
Thus poor poets the favour are denied<br />
Even to make exceptions, when they&rsquo;re tried.<br />
&rsquo;Tis hard that they must every one admit:<br />
Methinks I see some faces in the pit<br />
Which must of consequence be foes to wit.<br />
You who can judge, to sentence may proceed;<br />
But though he cannot write, let him be freed<br />
At least from their contempt who cannot read.</p>

set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
